# The V Programming Language: A Comprehensive Textbook Guide

Welcome to the ultimate learning guide for the V programming language! This textbook is structured specifically to take you from a complete beginner (zero programming experience) to an advanced V developer capable of building high-performance, concurrent, and safe systems applications. Rather than treating V as a list of syntax rules, this guide emphasizes a practical path: learn the core ideas, run the examples, and build small projects as you go.

> [!NOTE]
> **How to read this book:** Each section starts with a clear explanation of a fundamental programming concept, followed by concrete V code examples. Every example contains the exact code from the repository, formatted in clean code blocks so you can easily copy and run them yourself.

> [!TIP]
> **Interactive Learning:** You can test any code example from this guide live in your browser using the [V Playground](https://play.vlang.io/).

## Repository Structure

This book is paired with a topic-based repository layout so it is easier to explore examples by concept. The structure is intentionally arranged in a learning sequence rather than as a flat list of files:

- `variables_and_constants/`, `primitive_types/`, and `control_flow/` for the foundation of the language
- `functions/` and `structs/` for building reusable programs and modeling data
- `error_handling/`, `modules/`, and `testing/` for reliability and organization
- `concurrency/`, `channels/`, `json_and_orm/`, `sqlite/`, and `notes_api/` for real-world applications
- `language_updates_and_stdlib/` for newer language features and grouped standard library examples that are easier to browse by topic

Following this structure makes it simpler to move from small examples to larger projects, and it also gives contributors a clear place to add new lessons.

### A better way to think about the repo

- Start with the introductory folders when you are learning V for the first time.
- Use the middle sections when you are ready to write more structured programs.
- Explore the application-oriented folders once you want to build something practical.

### Contributing new content

When adding a new lesson, keep it in the most relevant topic folder and use a numbered naming pattern such as `01_topic_name/` so the learning flow stays predictable.

## Quick Start: Learn V by Building Things

If you are new to programming, the fastest way to learn V is to start small and build something real. Follow this sequence:

1. Install V and confirm it works with `v --version`.
2. Create a file named `hello.v` with a tiny program:

```v
fn main() {
	println('Hello, V!')
}
```

3. Run it with `v run hello.v`.
4. Build an executable with `v -o hello hello.v`.

V has a few ideas that are worth remembering early:

- Variables are immutable by default, so use `mut` when you need to change a value.
- Modules help organize larger programs.
- `option` and `result` make error handling explicit.
- `spawn` and channels make concurrency approachable.

## Core Language Essentials to Learn Early

A beginner-friendly roadmap becomes much clearer when you call out the core concepts that show up again and again in V programs:

- `mut` and immutable-by-default variables
- functions, parameters, and return values
- structs and methods for modeling data
- `enum` and `match` for branching on discrete choices
- modules and imports for organizing code
- `?` and `!` for option and result types
- `defer` for cleanup work before a function exits
- `unsafe` only when you truly need low-level access
- type aliases and sum types once you are comfortable with structs and enums

These ideas form the backbone of most V programs, so it is worth learning them in a small, practical order rather than trying to memorize every feature at once.

## Must-Learn-Before-Building Checklist

Before you start a larger project, make sure you can comfortably do the following:

- write a small program with a `main` function
- declare variables and explain when to use `mut`
- define and call functions with clear parameters and return types
- model simple data with structs
- choose between `if`, `match`, and `for` for control flow
- split code into modules and import them correctly
- handle optional or failing values with `?` and `!`
- use `defer` for cleanup work when needed
- avoid `unsafe` unless you truly need it

If you can do these reliably, you are ready to move from tiny examples to real programs.

## Why This Matters

The goal is not just to memorize syntax. Each concept in this guide solves a real programming problem:

- Variables and mutability help your program store and update information safely.
- Functions let you break a program into small, reusable pieces.
- Structs help you model real-world data such as users, files, or payments.
- Error handling makes programs more predictable and easier to debug.
- Concurrency helps programs do more work efficiently when tasks can run independently.

When you learn a new feature, ask yourself: “What problem does this solve?” and “How would I use it in a small program?”

## Suggested Learning Path

A beginner-friendly path through this guide is:

- Start with Chapters 1-4 to learn the basic syntax and control flow.
- Move into functions, structs, and modules to structure your programs.
- Practice with tests and error handling before tackling larger projects.
- Finish with concurrency, JSON, and databases by building a small app.

## Next-Level Language Features to Explore

Once the basics feel natural, the next step is to expand your comfort with a few higher-level features:

- type aliases for clearer naming
- sum types for values that can be one of several shapes
- generics for reusable data structures and helpers
- interfaces for shared behavior across different types
- higher-order functions and function values
- `unsafe` and pointers only when you need low-level performance or interop

These features are not required for every beginner project, but they become very useful once you start writing more structured or reusable code.

## Mini Projects to Try

These projects will make the guide feel much more practical:

- A command-line to-do list
- A number guessing game
- A simple file organizer or text search tool
- A notes app that stores data in JSON or SQLite
- A macOS desktop app with a native Cocoa UI: [vlang_simplegui](https://github.com/codecaine-zz/vlang_simplegui)
- A macOS desktop app with a webview-based UI: [vlang_macos_webview_app_template](https://github.com/codecaine-zz/vlang_macos_webview_app_template)

## Practice Exercises

Try these small exercises as you move through the guide:

1. Write a program that prints your name and age.
2. Create a function that adds two numbers and returns the result.
3. Build a tiny program that stores a user in a struct and prints the fields.
4. Write a loop that prints the first 10 even numbers.
5. Use an `option` or `result` in a small helper function and handle the failure case.

If you get stuck, write the smallest possible version first and test it before adding more features.

## Your First Project: A Tiny CLI Greeting App

A great first project is a small command-line app that asks for a name and prints a greeting. This lets you practice variables, functions, input, and output without getting overwhelmed.

### Step 1: Start with a simple main function

```v
fn main() {
	println('Hello, V!')
}
```

### Step 2: Add a name variable

```v
fn main() {
	name := 'Ada'
	println('Hello, ' + name + '!')
}
```

### Step 3: Make it interactive

```v
import os

fn main() {
	name := os.input('What is your name? ')
	println('Hello, ' + name + '!')
}
```

### Step 4: Improve it with a function

```v
import os

fn greet(name string) string {
	return 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
}

fn main() {
	name := os.input('What is your name? ')
	println(greet(name))
}
```

### Why this project is useful

This project teaches the core flow of programming in V:

- write a small program
- test it
- add a feature
- refactor it into functions
- make the output clearer

Once this feels easy, you can extend it with a command-line option, a loop, or a saved history file.

## What Most Programmers Want Next

A strong guide should help readers move from learning syntax to building and debugging real software. The following topics are especially useful for most programmers:

### Quick Reference

- Run a file: `v run hello.v`
- Build an executable: `v -o hello hello.v`
- Use `mut` when a value needs to change
- Use functions to keep logic organized
- Use modules to split larger projects into manageable files
- Use tests to verify behavior as you grow your program

### Common Beginner Mistakes

- Forgetting to make a variable `mut` before changing it
- Mixing up declaration and assignment
- Writing code without small, testable functions
- Trying to learn too many concepts at once instead of building one small feature

### Debugging and Reading Errors

When something fails, focus on the first compiler error, reduce the problem to a smaller example, and test one change at a time. This is often faster than changing many lines at once.

### Real-World Workflow

As your projects grow, you will want to know how to:

- split code into modules
- write tests
- structure folders clearly
- read documentation and standard library examples
- move from small scripts to larger applications

## From Practice to Real Projects

Once the basics feel comfortable, the next step is to build small applications that combine multiple ideas. A very effective progression is:

1. Build a tiny CLI tool that reads input and prints output.
2. Add functions, structs, and tests.
3. Introduce modules so the code is easier to maintain.
4. Add file I/O or JSON handling for persistence.
5. Explore concurrency for tasks that can run in parallel.

This progression helps learners move from “I can read examples” to “I can build useful software.”

## Where to Go Next

After finishing this guide, the best next steps are:

- read the official V documentation and examples
- try the V Playground for rapid experimentation
- build one project end to end instead of reading only
- contribute to or study real V repositories for idiomatic patterns

## Beginner Project Roadmap

A practical roadmap for new V developers could look like this:

### Milestone 1: CLI App

Build a small command-line app that accepts user input and prints useful output. This helps you practice functions, variables, and control flow.

### Milestone 2: Data App

Add file I/O or JSON handling so your app can save and load data. This introduces practical patterns for real-world applications.

### Milestone 3: Structured App

Split the app into modules and add structs for data models. This is where programs become easier to maintain.

### Milestone 4: Tested App

Write tests and improve reliability. This is an important step for building confidence as a programmer.

### Milestone 5: Concurrent App

Explore concurrency with `spawn` and channels for tasks that can run in parallel. This is where V becomes especially compelling for performance-oriented software.

## Setup Checklist

Before you start coding in V, make sure you have:

- V installed and available on your terminal
- a text editor or IDE with basic syntax highlighting
- a way to run and test small programs quickly
- a folder for practice files and mini projects

## Quick Glossary

- `mut`: makes a variable changeable
- `fn`: defines a function
- `struct`: defines a custom data type
- `module`: groups related code together
- `option`/`result`: explicit ways to handle missing or failing values
- `spawn`: runs code concurrently
- `channel`: passes data between concurrent tasks

## How to Use This Guide Effectively

To get the most from this book:

1. Read the explanation first, but do not stop there.
2. Run each example locally.
3. Change one small thing and observe what happens.
4. Write your own tiny version before moving on.
5. Apply each idea in a small project as soon as possible.

# Chapter 1: Getting Started with V

## Quick Access

Below is an index of all code examples in this chapter. You can use these links to jump directly to any specific code example:

**Code Comments**

- [Single Line Comments](#single-line-comments)
- [Multi Line Comments](#multi-line-comments)
- [Programm Commented All Places](#programm-commented-all-places)

---

This chapter introduces the core design philosophies of V. You will learn how to set up your development environment, compile and run programs, and document your code using comments.

## Code Comments

### Single Line Comments

_File location: [variables_and_constants/03_code_comments/01_single_line_comments/single_line_comments.v](variables_and_constants/03_code_comments/01_single_line_comments/single_line_comments.v)_

### Lesson: Single Line Comments

Comments are non-executable lines of text in a program that explain what the code does. They are ignored by the compiler but are essential for human developers. This lesson on **Single Line Comments** demonstrates how to write and format comments in V.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **single line comments**.

```v
module main

// greet function prints greetings to the console
pub fn greet() {
	println('Hello, Welcome to the Jungle!')
}

fn main() {
	greet()
}
```

---

### Multi Line Comments

_File location: [variables_and_constants/03_code_comments/02_multi_line_comments/multi_line_comments.v](variables_and_constants/03_code_comments/02_multi_line_comments/multi_line_comments.v)_

### Lesson: Multi Line Comments

In V, multi-line (or block) comments are enclosed between `/*` and `*/`.

> [!NOTE]
> **Nested Block Comments:** Unlike languages like C, C++, Java, or JavaScript, V supports **nested block comments**. This is a powerful feature that allows you to easily comment out large blocks of code even if they already contain block comments, without triggering syntax errors.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **multi line comments**.

```v
module main

/*
multiply is a function that accepts two integer arguments (x and y).
It performs multiplication and returns the integer product.

/*
Note: In V, block comments can be nested.
This is a nested block comment. In standard C, nesting block comments
would cause a compile error, but V's compiler parses them correctly.
*/
This is the end of the outer block comment.
*/
fn multiply(x int, y int) int {
	return x * y
}

fn main() {
	println(multiply(4, 5))
}
```

### Programm Commented All Places

_File location: [variables_and_constants/03_code_comments/03_program_commented_all_places/programm_commented_all_places.v](variables_and_constants/03_code_comments/03_program_commented_all_places/programm_commented_all_places.v)_

### Lesson: Programm Commented All Places

Comments are non-executable lines of text in a program that explain what the code does. They are ignored by the compiler but are essential for human developers. This lesson on **Programm Commented All Places** demonstrates how to write and format comments in V.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **programm commented all places**.

```v
module main

// Space3D A struct indicating the 3 dimensional coordinate system
struct Space3D {
mut:
	x int
	// x is an integer field that represents coordinate
	y int
	// y is an integer field that represents coordinate
	z int
	// z is an integer field that represents coordinate
}

/*
get_point is a function that returns a struct of Type Space3D with points x,y,z passed as input arguments to it
x is an input argument accepts values of type of int
y is an input argument accepts values of type of int
z is an input argument accepts values of type of int
get_point function returns a Struct result of type Space3D with its coordinates set as value passed as input arguments x, y and z
*/
fn get_point(x int, y int, z int) Space3D {
	return Space3D{
		x: x
		y: y
		z: z
	}
}

const origin = get_point(0, 0, 0)

// Defining origin as a constant
fn main() {
	// origin := Space3D {x: 0, y: 0, z:0}
	println(origin)
}
```

---

Variables are the basic storage units of any program. In this chapter, we explore how V handles variables with a safety-first mindset: variables are immutable by default, variable shadowing is forbidden, and constants are declared in module scopes. You will learn to manage program data safely and cleanly.

## Constants

### Define Single Constant

_File location: [variables_and_constants/02_constants/01_define_constant/01_define_single_constant.v](variables_and_constants/02_constants/01_define_constant/01_define_single_constant.v)_

### Lesson: Define Single Constant

Constants in V are defined using the `const` block. Constants are values that are known at compile time and never change throughout the execution of the program. By convention, constant names are written in lowercase, unlike many other languages.

This example shows how to define and use a single constant.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **define single constant**.

```v
const app_name = 'V on Wheels'

fn main() {
	println(app_name)
}
```

---

### Define Multiple Constants

_File location: [variables_and_constants/02_constants/01_define_constant/02_define_multiple_constants.v](variables_and_constants/02_constants/01_define_constant/02_define_multiple_constants.v)_

### Lesson: Define Multiple Constants

You can define multiple constants within a single `const` block. This keeps related constants grouped together and makes the code cleaner.

This example shows how to declare multiple constants (integers, strings, floats) together.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **define multiple constants**.

```v
const app_name = 'V on Wheels'
const max_connections = 1000
const decimal_places = 2

	println(app_name)
	println(max_connections)
	println(decimal_places)
	println(pi)
}
```

	return Space3D{
		x: x
		y: y
		z: z
	}
}

const origin = get_point(0, 0, 0)

fn main() {
	println(origin)
}
```

### Lesson: Cannot Define Constants Inside Functions

Variables and constants store state in V programs. This lesson on **Cannot Define Constants Inside Functions** covers declaration rules, default values, scopes, or constant naming conventions.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **cannot define constants inside functions**.

```v
module main

const app_name = 'V on Wheels'

fn main() {
        const greet = 'hi' // this is not top level constant definition, throws error.
        println(app_name)
}
```

---

### Constants Module - Main (main.v)

_File location: [variables_and_constants/02_constants/03_best_practices/03_module_prefix_to_identify_constants/main.v](variables_and_constants/02_constants/03_best_practices/03_module_prefix_to_identify_constants/main.v)_

### Lesson: Constants Module - Main

Variables and constants store state in V programs. This lesson on **Main** covers declaration rules, default values, scopes, or constant naming conventions.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **main**.

```v
module main

import mod1

fn main() {
	mod1.do_work()
}
```

---

### Constant Module Prefix - Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [variables_and_constants/02_constants/03_best_practices/03_module_prefix_to_identify_constants/mod1/file1.v](variables_and_constants/02_constants/03_best_practices/03_module_prefix_to_identify_constants/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Constant Module Prefix - Helper

## Variables

### Parallel Declaration Immutable Variables

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/01_variable_assignment/01_parallel_declaration/01_parallel_declaration_immutable_variables.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/01_variable_assignment/01_parallel_declaration/01_parallel_declaration_immutable_variables.v)_

### Lesson: Parallel Declaration Immutable Variables

In V, you can declare and initialize multiple variables in a single line. This is known as **parallel declaration**. By default, variables in V are **immutable** (read-only). Once assigned a value, they cannot be changed.

This program demonstrates declaring two variables `a` and `b` at the same time and assigning them initial values. Any attempt to modify `a` or `b` later in the code will cause a compile-time error.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **parallel declaration immutable variables**.

```v
fn main() {
	first_name, last_name, age := 'Ada', 'Lovelace', 36
	println('${first_name} ${last_name} is ${age} years old')
	println('Next milestone: ${first_name} will speak at the conference')
}
```

---

### Parallel Declaration Mutable Variables

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/01_variable_assignment/01_parallel_declaration/02_parallel\_\_declaration_mutable_variables.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/01_variable_assignment/01_parallel_declaration/02_parallel__declaration_mutable_variables.v)_

### Lesson: Parallel Declaration Mutable Variables

If you want to modify parallelly declared variables later, you must explicitly mark them as mutable using the `mut` keyword. In V, mutability is always explicit to make code safer and easier to reason about.

Here, we declare two mutable variables `a` and `b` at the same time using `mut`. We then reassign their values using the standard assignment operator (`=`).

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **parallel declaration mutable variables**.

```v
fn main() {

### Declare Mutable Variable

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/01_mutable_immutable_variables/01_mutable/01_declare_mutable_variable.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/01_mutable_immutable_variables/01_mutable/01_declare_mutable_variable.v)_

### Lesson: Declare Mutable Variable

By default, all variables in V are **immutable** (their values cannot change). To declare a variable whose value can be modified later, you must prepend the `mut` keyword before the variable name.

This example shows how to declare a mutable variable, change its value, and print the results.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **declare mutable variable**.

```v
fn main() {
	mut counter := 0
	counter += 1
	println(counter)
}
```

### Lesson: Cannot Update Mutable With Another Type

Variables and constants store state in V programs. This lesson on **Cannot Update Mutable With Another Type** covers declaration rules, default values, scopes, or constant naming conventions.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **cannot update mutable with another type**.

```v
fn main() {
	mut i := 10
	i = 100
	i = 'Apple' // throws error

### Cannot Update Immutable Variables

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/01_mutable_immutable_variables/02_immutable/02_cannot_update_immutable_variables.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/01_mutable_immutable_variables/02_immutable/02_cannot_update_immutable_variables.v)_

### Lesson: Cannot Update Immutable Variables

One of V's core safety features is **immutability by default**. If you declare a variable without the `mut` keyword and then try to reassign it a new value, the compiler will refuse to compile the program.

This example demonstrates what happens when you try to update an immutable variable (expect a compiler error).

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **cannot update immutable variables**.

```v
fn main() {
	msg := 'Hello'
	msg = 'Good Day!' // throws error
}
```

---

### Declared And Assigned

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/02_declared_must_be_assigned/01_declared_and_assigned.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/02_declared_must_be_assigned/01_declared_and_assigned.v)_

### Lesson: Declared And Assigned

Variables and constants store state in V programs. This lesson on **Declared And Assigned** covers declaration rules, default values, scopes, or constant naming conventions.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **declared and assigned**.

```v
fn main() {
	mut i := 0
	// declared and assigned
	println(i)
}
```

---

### Declared And Not Assigned

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/02_declared_must_be_assigned/02_declared_and_not_assigned.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/02_declared_must_be_assigned/02_declared_and_not_assigned.v)_

### Lesson: Declared And Not Assigned

V does not allow variables to be declared without an initial value. Unlike other languages that initialize variables to a default 'zero' value or `null`, V forces you to explicitly provide a value. This prevents uninitialized variable bugs.

This example illustrates that declaring a variable without an assignment is a compilation error.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **declared and not assigned**.

```v
fn main() {
	mut a // throws error
}
```

### Unused Variables Will Be Warned

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/03_declared_must_be_consumed/01_unused_variables_will_be_warned.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/02_variable_features/03_declared_must_be_consumed/01_unused_variables_will_be_warned.v)_

### Lesson: Unused Variables Will Be Warned

To keep codebases clean and efficient, the V compiler detects if you declare a variable but never use (consume) it. By default, V treats unused variables as a compilation warning/error, encouraging you to clean up dead code.

This example shows a declared variable that is never used.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **unused variables will be warned**.

```v
fn main() {
	i := 'hello' // i is not used anywhere, so warns when run in dev mode and throws error when run in prod mode
	x := 3
	y := 2
	println(x + y)
}
```

### Global Variables Not Allowed - Scope Demo

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/03_limitations/01_global_variables/01_global_variables_not_allowed.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/03_limitations/01_global_variables/01_global_variables_not_allowed.v)_

### Lesson: Global Variables Not Allowed - Scope Demo

V does not allow global variables by default. Global state is a major source of bugs, race conditions in multi-threaded applications, and poor code structure. By forbidding globals, V enforces clean, modular code passing state via arguments.

These examples demonstrate that declaring variables outside of the main function or modules is strictly prohibited.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **global variables not allowed**.

```v
module main

fn method1() {
	msg := 'Hello from Method1'
	println(msg)
}

fn main() {
	method1()
	println(msg) // Will throw error as msg declared and accessible only in method1
}
```

### Lesson: Variable Redeclaration

Variables and constants store state in V programs. This lesson on **Variable Redeclaration** covers declaration rules, default values, scopes, or constant naming conventions.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **variable redeclaration**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
        x := 3
        y := 2
        println(x + y)
        x := 5 // re-definition of variable x is not allowed
}
```

fn method1() {
	msg := 'Hello from Method1'
	println(msg)
}

fn method2() {
	msg := 'Hello from Method2'
	println(msg)
}

fn main() {
	method1()
	method2()
}
```

### Variable Shadowing Not Allowed

_File location: [variables_and_constants/01_variables/03_limitations/03_variable_shadowing/variable_shadowing_not_allowed.v](variables_and_constants/01_variables/03_limitations/03_variable_shadowing/variable_shadowing_not_allowed.v)_

### Lesson: Variable Shadowing Not Allowed

**Variable shadowing** happens when a variable declared within an inner scope (like a loop or a function block) has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. V strictly forbids variable shadowing to prevent confusion and accidental bugs where a developer modifies the wrong variable.

This example shows how V rejects shadowed variable declarations.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **variable shadowing not allowed**.

```v
module main

fn scope_demo() {
	x := 10
	println(x)
	if true {
		x := 20 // throws error as shadowing is not allowed
		println(x)
	}
	println(x)
}

fn main() {
	scope_demo()
}
```

## Primitive Types Demo

### Primitive Types Demo Code

_File location: [primitive_types/05_primitive_types_demo/primitive_types_demo.v](primitive_types/05_primitive_types_demo/primitive_types_demo.v)_

### Lesson: Primitive Types Demo Code

This comprehensive example demonstrates every primitive data type in V:

- **Boolean**: `bool` (representing `true` or `false`).
- **String**: `string` (representing an immutable array of bytes).
- **Rune**: `rune` (representing a single Unicode code point, alias for `u32`).
- **Signed Integers**: `i8` (8-bit), `i16` (16-bit), `int` (32-bit), `i64` (64-bit).
- **Unsigned Integers**: `u8` (8-bit, alias `byte`), `u16` (16-bit), `u32` (32-bit), `u64` (64-bit).
- **Platform-dependent sizes**: `isize` (signed size of a pointer), `usize` (unsigned size of a pointer).
- **Floating Point Numbers**: `f32` (32-bit single-precision), `f64` (64-bit double-precision).

For each type, the example initializes a value and prints its value, type (using `typeof(var).name`), and size in bytes (using `sizeof(var)`).

V is a statically-typed language, meaning every variable has a fixed data type at compile time. In this chapter, you will learn about V's primitive types: booleans for logic, numeric types for numbers, runes for single characters, and strings for text. You will also learn about V's rich set of built-in methods on these types.

## Boolean Type

### Logical Operators

_File location: [primitive_types/01_boolean_type/01_logical_operators/01_logical_operators.v](primitive_types/01_boolean_type/01_logical_operators/01_logical_operators.v)_

### Lesson: Logical Operators

In V, primitive data types are the core building blocks of the language. This section details how to declare and use **Logical Operators** in a simple, straightforward manner. Beginners should pay close attention to how variables of this type are initialized and how built-in methods are called on them.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **logical operators**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	t := true
	f := false

	// Logical And using && operator
	and_tt := t && t
	and_tf := t && f
	and_ft := f && t
	and_ff := f && f

	println('Logical And using && operator')
	println('${t} && ${t} = ${and_tt}')
	println('${t} && ${f} = ${and_tf}')
	println('${f} && ${t} = ${and_ft}')
	println('${f} && ${f} = ${and_ff}')
	println('')

	// Logical OR using || operator
	or_tt := t || t
	or_tf := t || f
	or_ft := f || t
	or_ff := f || f

	println('Logical OR using || Operator')
	println('${t} || ${t} = ${or_tt}')
	println('${t} || ${f} = ${or_tf}')
	println('${f} || ${t} = ${or_ft}')
	println('${f} || ${f} = ${or_ff}')
	println('')

	// Logical not using ! Operator
	not_t := !t
	not_f := !f

	println('Logical not using ! Operator')
	println('!${t} = ${not_t}')
	println('!${f} = ${not_f}')
}
```

### Relational Operators

_File location: [primitive_types/01_boolean_type/02_relational_operators/01_relational_operators.v](primitive_types/01_boolean_type/02_relational_operators/01_relational_operators.v)_

### Lesson: Relational Operators

In V, primitive data types are the core building blocks of the language. This section details how to declare and use **Relational Operators** in a simple, straightforward manner. Beginners should pay close attention to how variables of this type are initialized and how built-in methods are called on them.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **relational operators**.

```v
module main

struct Note {
	id        int
	detail    string
	completed bool
}

fn main() {
	mut n := Note{
		id:     1001
		detail: 'get groceries'
	}
	println(n.completed) // un-assigned bool field will be false by default

	// Comparing using Relational operator >
	if n.id > 1000 { // comparison of note id of integer type to another integer evaluates to a boolean
		println('The note id is greater than 1000')
	} else {
		println('The note id is less than 1000')
	}

	// Comparing using Relational operator ==
	if n.detail == 'get groceries' {
		println('The note details about groceries')
	}

	// Comparing using Relational operator !=
	if n.detail != 'get dairy products' {
		println('The note does not details about dairy products')
	}
}
```

### Boolean Methods

_File location: [primitive_types/01_boolean_type/03_boolean_methods/01_boolean_methods.v](primitive_types/01_boolean_type/03_boolean_methods/01_boolean_methods.v)_

### Lesson: Boolean Methods

Booleans in V are simple `true` or `false` values. V provides built-in methods on boolean types, such as `str()`, which converts the boolean value to its string representation (`'true'` or `'false'`).

This is useful for logging, printing, or interpolating booleans into strings.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **boolean methods**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	t := true
	f := false

	// str() returns string representation ('true' or 'false')
	println(t.str()) // true
	println(f.str()) // false
}
```

## Numeric Types

### Declaring Integers

_File location: [primitive_types/02_numeric_types/01_declaring_integers/01_declaring_integers/01_declaring_integers.v](primitive_types/02_numeric_types/01_declaring_integers/01_declaring_integers/01_declaring_integers.v)_

### Lesson: Declaring Integers

V has several built-in integer types, both signed and unsigned, of various sizes (e.g., `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` for signed integers, and `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64` for unsigned integers). If you declare an integer using `:=`, V defaults to the standard 32-bit integer (`int`).

This example demonstrates how to declare different integer types.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **declaring integers**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	x := 1
	println(typeof(x).name)
	// int

	i := 1_000
	j := 1000

	println(i == j) // true
}
```

### Lesson: Hex Binary Octa Notation Of Declaring Integers

V has several built-in integer types, both signed and unsigned, of various sizes (e.g., `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` for signed integers, and `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64` for unsigned integers). If you declare an integer using `:=`, V defaults to the standard 32-bit integer (`int`).

This example demonstrates how to declare different integer types.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **hex binary octa notation of declaring integers**.

```v
module main

fn demo() {
	h1 := 0x64 // hexadecimal starts with 0x
	b1 := 0b1100100 // binary starts with 0b
	o1 := 0o144 // Octal starts with 0o
	println('Value of var h1 with hexadecimal value : ${h1}')
	println('Data type of var h1 with hexadecimal value : ${typeof(h1).name}')
	println('Value of var b1 with binary value : ${b1}')
	println('Data type of var b1 with binary value : ${typeof(b1).name}')
	println('Value of var o1 with octal value : ${o1}')
	println('Data type of var o1 with octal value : ${typeof(o1).name}')
}

fn main() {
	demo()
}
```

### Promoting Numeric Types

_File location: [primitive_types/02_numeric_types/02_promoting_numeric_types/01_promoting_numeric_types.v](primitive_types/02_numeric_types/02_promoting_numeric_types/01_promoting_numeric_types.v)_

### Lesson: Promoting Numeric Types

V is very strict about types. It does not perform implicit type conversion (coercion) between different numeric types to prevent accidental precision loss or overflow bugs. If you want to perform arithmetic operations on different types, you must explicitly cast them.

This example shows how to cast (promote) smaller integer types to larger ones or to floats.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **promoting numeric types**.

```v

### String Read Only Array Of Bytes

_File location: [primitive_types/03_string_type/01_working_with_strings/01_string_read_only_array_of_bytes/01_string_read_only_array_of_bytes.v](primitive_types/03_string_type/01_working_with_strings/01_string_read_only_array_of_bytes/01_string_read_only_array_of_bytes.v)_

### Lesson: String Read Only Array Of Bytes

In V, a string is internally represented as a read-only array of bytes (`u8`). This means you can access individual bytes of a string using array indexing (`str[index]`), but you cannot change them.

This example shows how to read bytes from a string and print their values.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **string read only array of bytes**.

```v
fn main() {
	fruit := 'Orange'

### Lesson: Strings Immutable By Default

Strings in V are completely immutable. Once a string is created, its characters cannot be modified in place. Any operation that manipulates a string (such as replacing characters or converting to uppercase) returns a brand new string instead of modifying the original.

This example demonstrates that strings are read-only and cannot be changed.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **strings immutable by default**.

```v
fn main() {
	s := 'hello'
	// variable s is immutable
	s = 'Hello!'
	// this results in error
}
```

### Lesson: Declaring Mutable Strings

While strings are immutable, you can declare a mutable string variable using `mut`. This allows the variable to be reassigned to a new string value, or appended to using the `+=` operator.

This example shows how to declare a mutable string and append text to it.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **declaring mutable strings**.

```v
fn main() {
	mut msg := 'Hello Friend!'
	msg = 'Hope you are doing good.'
	println(msg)
	// Hope you are doing good.
	msg = msg + ' There is a surprise for you.'
	println(msg)
	// Hope you are doing good. There is a surprise for you.
}
```

### Cannot Mutate String Elements

_File location: [primitive_types/03_string_type/01_working_with_strings/04_cannot_mutate_string_elements/04_cannot_mutate_string_elements.v](primitive_types/03_string_type/01_working_with_strings/04_cannot_mutate_string_elements/04_cannot_mutate_string_elements.v)_

### Lesson: Cannot Mutate String Elements

Even if a string variable is declared with `mut`, you cannot mutate its individual characters or bytes directly via index assignment (e.g., `s[0] = \`a\``). The compiler will throw an error to protect string integrity.

This program shows that element mutation is strictly forbidden.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **cannot mutate string elements**.

```v
fn main() {
	mut greet := 'good Day'

	greet[0] = 'G' // this results in error
}
```

### Lesson: String Interpolation

**String interpolation** is a clean way to insert variables or expressions inside a string literal. In V, you do this by wrapping the variable or expression in `${variable}` inside a single-quoted string.

This example demonstrates how to format strings with variable values.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **string interpolation**.

```v
fn main() {
	a := 'coding'
	b := 'fun'
	println('${a} is ${b}')
	println('${a} is ${b}')
}
```

### Lesson: Escape Special Characters

V strings support standard escape characters (like `\n` for newlines, `\t` for tabs, and `\\` for backslashes) to represent special characters inside a string literal.

This example shows how these escape sequences are rendered in the console.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **escape special characters**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	// 1. Newline escape character (\n)
	println('Hello\nWorld!')

	// 2. Tab escape character (\t)
	println('Name:\tAlice\tAge:\t25')

	// 3. Backslash escape character (\\)
	println('File path: C:\\Program Files\\V')

	// 4. Escaping single quotes (\') in a single-quoted string
	println("It's my Daughter's birthday!")

	// 5. Escaping double quotes (\") in a double-quoted string
	println('She said, "V is fast!"')
}
```

### Lesson: Declare Raw Strings

If you want to write a string literal where escape sequences (like `\n`) are treated as literal text instead of special commands, you can declare a **raw string** by prefixing the string literal with `r` (e.g., `r\'hello\nworld\'`).

This is extremely useful when writing regular expressions or file paths.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **declare raw strings**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	i := r'hi \how are you/?'
	println(i)
}

### Lesson: Extract Substring From String Literal

V provides two main techniques to extract substrings from a string literal or variable:

1. **The `.substr(start, end)` Method**: Takes the starting index (inclusive) and ending index (exclusive) as parameters.
2. **Range Slicing Syntax `[start..end]`**: A clean and idiomatic syntax (similar to Go and Rust) where you specify range offsets. If the starting index is omitted (e.g. `[..end]`), it defaults to `0`. If the ending index is omitted (e.g. `[start..]`), it defaults to the length of the string.

Both techniques are demonstrated in the example below.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **extract substring from string literal**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	a := 'Camel'

	// Method 1: Using the substr(start, end) method
	// Extracts characters from index 0 up to (but not including) index 3
	b := a.substr(0, 3)
	println(b) // Output: Cam

	// Method 2: Using idiomatic range slicing syntax [start..end] (similar to Go/Rust)
	// Slices from index 1 up to (but not including) index 4
	c := a[1..4]
	println(c) // Output: ame

	// Method 3: Slicing from start to index [..end]
	// If the start index is omitted, it defaults to 0
	d := a[..3]
	println(d) // Output: Cam

	// Method 4: Slicing from index to end [start..]
	// If the end index is omitted, it defaults to the string length
	e := a[2..]
	println(e) // Output: mel
}
```

Collections allow you to group multiple data items together. V provides two primary built-in collection types: **arrays** (ordered lists of elements) and **maps** (key-value dictionaries). This chapter covers creating, accessing, and manipulating these collections using modern functional patterns like `map` and `filter`.

### Access Array Elements Using Slices

_File location: [arrays_and_maps/01_arrays/03_accessing_array_elements/02_access_array_elements_using_slices/02_access_array_elements_using_slices.v](arrays_and_maps/01_arrays/03_accessing_array_elements/02_access_array_elements_using_slices/02_access_array_elements_using_slices.v)_

### Lesson: Access Array Elements Using Slices

An **array** is a collection of elements of the same type. In V, you can retrieve a subset of elements by slicing the array. Slicing uses the `[start..end]` syntax, which creates a new array containing elements from the `start` index up to (but not including) the `end` index.

#### Positive Slicing

Positive indices represent offsets from the beginning of the array (starting at `0`). For example, `sports[1..3]` returns a slice from index `1` to `2`.

#### Negative Slicing

V does not support negative indices natively in slices (e.g., `sports[-2..]` will cause a compiler error). To achieve the effect of negative slicing (indexing from the end of the array), you calculate the start and/or end index using the array's `.len` property:

- **Excluding the last element**: `sports[..sports.len - 1]` (equivalent to Python's `sports[..-1]`)
- **Range from the end**: `sports[sports.len - 3 .. sports.len - 1]` (equivalent to Python's `sports[-3..-1]`)
- **Last N elements**: `sports[sports.len - 2 ..]` (equivalent to Python's `sports[-2..]`)

#### Slices are References

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In V, **slices are reference views** of the original array, not copies.
>
> - Modifying any element inside a slice **will modify the original array**.
> - Assigning a slice to a variable is considered unsafe/restricted unless you wrap it in an `unsafe` block (`mut sl := unsafe { arr[1..4] }`) or clone it explicitly.
> - To get a separate array slice by value (so modifications do not affect the original array), append `.clone()` to the end of the slice expression (`mut sl_copy := arr[1..4].clone()`).

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **access array elements using slices**, including positive slicing, `.len`-based negative slicing, reference mutation via `unsafe` blocks, and copying by value with `.clone()`.

```v
fn main() {
	mut sports := ['cricket', 'hockey', 'football', 'basketball', 'tennis']

	// Positive slicing: from index 1 to 3 (excluding index 3)
	println(sports[1..3]) // ['hockey', 'football']

	// V does not support negative indices natively in slices (e.g., sports[-2..] will not compile).
	// To achieve "negative slicing" (indexing from the end of the array), use the `.len` property:

	// Slice up to the last element (excluding it): Python's sports[..-1]
	println(sports[..sports.len - 1]) // ['cricket', 'hockey', 'football', 'basketball']

	// Slice from 3rd to last up to 1st to last (excluding it): Python's sports[-3..-1]
	println(sports[sports.len - 3..sports.len - 1]) // ['football', 'basketball']

	// Slice the last two elements: Python's sports[-2..]
	println(sports[sports.len - 2..]) // ['basketball', 'tennis']

	// --- REFERENCE VS VALUE BEHAVIOR ---
	// In V, slices are reference views of the original array.
	// If you modify an element of a slice, it affects the original array.
	// Note: To prevent unsafe behavior, assigning a slice to a variable requires an `unsafe` block
	// if you want it by-reference, or an explicit `.clone()` to get a copy by-value.

	// 1. Modifying by reference (using unsafe)
	mut original := [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
	mut ref_slice := unsafe { original[1..4] }
	ref_slice[0] = 99
	println(original) // [10, 99, 30, 40, 50] (Original is modified!)

	// 2. Modifying by value (using .clone())
	mut original_two := [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
	mut val_slice := original_two[1..4].clone()
	val_slice[0] = 99
	println(original_two) // [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] (Original remains unchanged!)
}
```

An **array** is a collection of elements of the same type. In V, arrays are declared using square brackets. They are index-based, dynamically sized, and provide built-in methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sort()` for functional-style manipulation.

These examples show how to initialize, append, clone, copy, and manipulate arrays.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **sort string array**.

```v
fn main() {
	mut fruits := ['Apples', 'avocado', 'banana', 'Orange']

	fruits.sort()
	// ascending order
	println(fruits)
	fruits.sort(a > b)
	// reverse order
	println(fruits)
}
```

### Map Methods

_File location: [arrays_and_maps/02_maps/09_map_methods/01_map_methods/01_map_methods.v](arrays_and_maps/02_maps/09_map_methods/01_map_methods/01_map_methods.v)_

### Lesson: Map Methods

A **map** is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, also known as a dictionary or associative array. In V, map keys must be strings or integer types, and values can be of any type. Maps are declared using curly braces with colon separators.

These examples cover how to initialize maps, look up keys, add or delete entries, and check if a key exists.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **map methods**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	println('--- Map Built-in Methods ---')

	mut m := {
		'one': 1
		'two': 2
	}
	println('initial map: ${m}') // {"one": 1, "two": 2}

	// 1. keys()
	// Returns an array containing all keys in the map.
	println('keys: ${m.keys()}') // ["one", "two"]

	// 2. values()
	// Returns an array containing all values in the map.
	println('values: ${m.values()}') // [1, 2]

	// 3. clone()
	// Returns a deep copy of the map.
	mut m_clone := m.clone()
	println('clone: ${m_clone}') // {"one": 1, "two": 2}

	// 4. delete(key)
	// Removes a key-value pair from the map by key.
	m.delete('one')
	println('delete: ${m}') // {"two": 2}

	// 5. reserve(capacity)
	// Pre-allocates space for at least capacity elements in the map.
	m.reserve(10)
	println('reserve: reserved capacity successfully')

	// 6. clear()
	// Removes all key-value pairs from the map without deallocating data.
	m.clear()
	println('clear: len is ${m.len}') // 0

	// 7. move()
	// Moves the map contents to a new map variable and clears the original map to empty.
	mut m_move := {
		'three': 3
		'four':  4
	}
	moved := m_move.move()
	println('move (new map): ${moved}') // {"three": 3, "four": 4}
	println('move (original map): ${m_move}') // {}

	// 8. free() (unsafe)
	// Deallocates the map memory.
	mut m_free := {
		'temp': 100
	}
	unsafe {
		m_free.free()
	}
	println('free: map freed successfully')
}
```

### Import Maps Helpers

_File location: [arrays_and_maps/02_maps/09_map_methods/02_import_maps_helpers/02_import_maps_helpers.v](arrays_and_maps/02_maps/09_map_methods/02_import_maps_helpers/02_import_maps_helpers.v)_

### Lesson: Import Maps Helpers

The `maps` module provides higher-level helpers for filtering, transforming, inverting, merging, and converting between maps and arrays. These helpers are useful when you want to work with map data in a functional style without manually writing the loops yourself.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **import maps helpers**.

```v
module main

import maps

fn main() {
	println('--- Import Maps Module Helpers ---')

	// Start with a simple map of fruit counts.
	m1 := {
		'apple':  1
		'banana': 2
		'cherry': 3
	}

	// filter() keeps only the entries that satisfy the callback condition.
	filtered := maps.filter(m1, fn (k string, v int) bool {
		return v > 1
	})
	println('filter(): ${filtered}')

	// to_array() builds a new array by transforming each entry.
	keys_upper := maps.to_array(m1, fn (k string, v int) string {
		return k.to_upper()
	})
	println('to_array(): ${keys_upper}')

	// invert() swaps each key/value pair so the values become the keys.
	inverted := maps.invert(m1)
	println('invert(): ${inverted}')

	// from_array() creates a map from a list of strings.
	fruits := ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
	map_from_arr := maps.from_array(fruits)
	println('from_array(): ${map_from_arr}')

	// merge() combines two maps and lets the second map override duplicates.
	m2 := {
		'banana': 20
		'date':   4
	}
	merged := maps.merge(m1, m2)
	println('merge(): ${merged}')

	// merge_in_place() mutates the first map directly.
	mut mut_map := {
		'a': 1
	}
	maps.merge_in_place(mut mut_map, {
		'b': 2
		'c': 3
	})
	println('merge_in_place(): ${mut_map}')

	// flat_map() can expand each entry into multiple output values.
	flat_items := maps.flat_map[string, int, string](m1, fn (k string, v int) []string {
		return [k, v.str()]
	})
	println('flat_map(): ${flat_items}')

	// to_map() transforms each entry into a new key/value pair.
	transformed := maps.to_map[string, int, string, int](m1, fn (k string, v int) (string, int) {
		return k.to_upper(), v * 10
	})
	println('to_map(): ${transformed}')
}
```

Functions let you turn repeated or complex logic into small, named building blocks. A useful mental model is: define the task, give it inputs if needed, do the work, and return a useful result. This chapter starts with simple functions and then introduces multiple returns, optional results, higher-order functions, and cleanup with `defer`.

## Advanced Function Features

### Function Returns Value Example 1

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/01_functions_return_or_just_perform_operations/01_functions_return_value_or_just_perform_routine/01_function_returns_value_example_1.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/01_functions_return_or_just_perform_operations/01_functions_return_value_or_just_perform_routine/01_function_returns_value_example_1.v)_

### Lesson: Function Returns Value Example 1

A simple function is a small helper that turns inputs into a useful result. The basic pattern is: define the function, pass in values, do some work, and return the answer. In this example, `add` takes two integers and returns their sum.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **function returns value example 1**.

```v
fn add(a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

fn main() {
	println(add(2, 3))
}
```

---

### Function Returns Value Example 2

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/01_functions_return_or_just_perform_operations/01_functions_return_value_or_just_perform_routine/02_function_returns_value_example_2.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/01_functions_return_or_just_perform_operations/01_functions_return_value_or_just_perform_routine/02_function_returns_value_example_2.v)_

### Lesson: Function Returns Value Example 2

A function does not need to print anything itself. It can build a value and hand it back to the caller. Here, `say_hello` returns a greeting string, and `main` decides how to display it.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **function returns value example 2**.

```v
fn say_hello() string {
	return 'Hello!'
}

fn main() {
	// call the method
	res := say_hello()
	println(res)
	// prints: Hello!
}
```

---

### Functions Without Return Type

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/01_functions_return_or_just_perform_operations/01_functions_return_value_or_just_perform_routine/03_funtions_without_return_type.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/01_functions_return_or_just_perform_operations/01_functions_return_value_or_just_perform_routine/03_funtions_without_return_type.v)_

### Lesson: Functions Without Return Type

Some functions are used for actions rather than calculations. They may print output, write files, or update state. In that case, you can leave out the return type and focus on the side effect.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **funtions without return type**.

```v
fn console_greeter() {
	println('Hello!')
}

fn main() {
	console_greeter()
	// prints: Hello!
}
```

---

### Function With Input Arguments

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/02_function_and_input_arguments/01_function_with_input_arguments.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/02_function_and_input_arguments/01_function_with_input_arguments.v)_

### Lesson: Function With Input Arguments

Functions become much more useful when they accept inputs. This example uses two numbers as arguments and returns their sum, showing the classic input → process → output flow.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **function with input arguments**.

```v
fn add(a int, b int) int {
	return a + b
}

fn main() {
	res := add(2, 4)
	println(res)
	// prints: 6
}
```

---

### Function Return Multiple Values

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/03_function_return_multiple_values/01_function_return_multiple_values.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/03_function_return_multiple_values/01_function_return_multiple_values.v)_

### Lesson: Function Return Multiple Values

A function can return more than one value when those values belong together. A common pattern is returning both the main result and a related detail, such as a length or status. Here, `greet_and_message_length` returns both the greeting and its length.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **function return multiple values**.

```v
fn greet_and_message_length(name string) (string, int) {
	mut greeting := 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
	return greeting, greeting.len
}

fn main() {
	i, j := greet_and_message_length('Navule')
	println(i)
	println(j)
}
```

---

### Ignore Function Return Value

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/04_ignore_function_return_values/01_ignore_function_return_value.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/04_ignore_function_return_values/01_ignore_function_return_value.v)_

### Lesson: Ignore Function Return Value

Sometimes you only care about one returned value. V lets you ignore the rest with `_`, which keeps the code readable when you are only interested in part of the result.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **ignore function return value**.

```v
fn greet_and_message_length(name string) (string, int) {
	mut greeting := 'Hello, ' + name + '!'
	return greeting, greeting.len
}

fn main() {
	i, _ := greet_and_message_length('Navule')
	println(i)
}
```

---

### Function Calls Other Function

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/05_function_calls_other_function/01_function_calls_other_function.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/05_function_calls_other_function/01_function_calls_other_function.v)_

### Lesson: Function Calls Other Function

Functions can call other functions to split a bigger problem into smaller steps. This makes the code easier to understand and easier to reuse later.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **function calls other function**.

```v
fn greet(p string) string {
	return 'Hello, ${p}!'
}

fn welcome(p string) string {
	msg := 'Nice to meet you!'
	mut g := greet(p)
	g = g + ' ${msg}'
	return g
}

fn main() {
	res := welcome('Visitor')
	println(res)
}
```

---

### Example 1

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/06_allowed_function_input_argument_types/01_example_1.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/06_allowed_function_input_argument_types/01_example_1.v)_

### Lesson: Example 1

V functions support several advanced features:

- **Multiple Return Values**: A function can return more than one value (often a result and an error).
- **Blank Identifier (`_`)**: Used to discard unwanted return values.
- **Defer**: Schedules a block of code to run right before the function exits, which is excellent for resource cleanup.
- **Anonymous Functions & Closures**: Functions defined inline that can capture variables from their outer scope.

These examples illustrate these powerful concepts.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **example 1**.

```v
fn increment_array_items(arr []int, inc int) []int {
	mut tmp := arr.clone()
	for mut i in tmp {
		i += inc
	}
	return tmp
}

fn main() {
	a := [5, 6]

	res := increment_array_items(a, 100)

	println('a: ${a}')
	println('res: ${res}')
}
```

- **Blank Identifier (`_`)**: Used to discard unwanted return values.
- **Defer**: Schedules a block of code to run right before the function exits, which is excellent for resource cleanup.
- **Anonymous Functions & Closures**: Functions defined inline that can capture variables from their outer scope.

These examples illustrate these powerful concepts.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **example 2**.

```v
fn increment_array_items(mut arr []int, inc int) {
	for mut i in arr {
		i += inc
	}
}

fn main() {
	mut a := [5, 6]
	increment_array_items(mut a, 100)
	// Must specify mut keyword when sending value to mut arg of a function
	println('a: ${a}')
}
```

_File location: [functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/12_functions_as_elements_of_array_or_map/01_functions_as_elements_of_array_or_map.v](functions/02_understanding_funtion_features/12_functions_as_elements_of_array_or_map/01_functions_as_elements_of_array_or_map.v)_

### Lesson: Functions As Elements Of Array Or Map

Functions can be stored in arrays and maps just like other values. This allows you to choose an operation dynamically at runtime, which is helpful in flexible programs.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **functions as elements of array or map**.

```v
module main

fn adder(i int, j int) int {
	return i + j
}

fn subtractor(i int, j int) int {
	return i - j
}

fn multiplier(i int, j int) int {
	return i * j
}

fn main() {
	i, j := 2, 5
	println('Functions as elements of an Array')
	funcs := [adder, subtractor, multiplier]

	for f in funcs {
		res := f(i, j)
		println(res)
	}
	println('Functions as elements of Map')
	d := {
		'sum':        adder
		'difference': subtractor
		'product':    multiplier
	}

	for key, val in d {
		res := val(i, j)
		println('${key} of ${i} and ${j}: ${res}')
	}
}
```

### Hello

_File location: [functions/01_function_types/00_main_function/hello.v](functions/01_function_types/00_main_function/hello.v)_

### Lesson: Hello

Every V program starts with `main()`. It is the entry point where execution begins, so it is the first function most beginners learn.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **hello**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	println('Welcome to the World of V!')
}
```

### Basic Functions

_File location: [functions/01_function_types/01_basic_functions/basic_functions.v](functions/01_function_types/01_basic_functions/basic_functions.v)_

### Lesson: Basic Functions

A basic function packages a task so you can call it later instead of repeating the same code. This example shows a function that prints a message when invoked.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **basic functions**.

```v
// Define a simple function that prints a greeting.
fn greet(name string) {
	println('Hello, ${name}!')
}

fn main() {
	// Call the function with different argument values.
	greet('Ada')
	greet('Grace')
}
```

### Anonymous Functions

_File location: [functions/01_function_types/02_anonymous_functions/anonymous_functions.v](functions/01_function_types/02_anonymous_functions/anonymous_functions.v)_

### Lesson: Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions are defined inline and are useful for short, one-off behavior. They are handy when you want a quick callback without creating a named function.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **anonymous functions**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	// Create an anonymous function and assign it to a variable.
	greet := fn (name string) {
		println('Hello, ${name}')
	}

	// Invoke the function twice with different names.
	greet('Pavan')
	greet('Sahithi')
}
```

	return 'Good Evening'
}

fn greet(f fn () string, name string) string {
	return '${f()}, ${name}!'
}

fn main() {
	mut res := greet(greet_morning, 'Pavan')
	println(res)

	res = greet(greet_evening, 'Sahithi')
	println(res)

	res = greet(fn () string {
		return 'New year greetings to you'
	}, 'Sahithi')
	println(res)
}
```

		}
	}
}

fn main() {
	i, j := 2, 5
	mut f := fetch(.add) // return adder function
	mut res := f(i, j) // calls adder(2, 5)
	println('sum of ${i} and ${j}: ${res}')

	f = fetch(.sub) // returns subtractor function
	res = f(i, j) // calls subtractor(2, 5)
	println('difference of ${i} and ${j}: ${res}')

	f = fetch(.mul) // returns multipler function
	res = f(i, j) // calls multiplier(2, 5)
	println('product of ${i} and ${j}: ${res}')
}
```

### Lambda Expressions

_File location: [functions/01_function_types/04_lambda_expressions/lambda_expressions.v](functions/01_function_types/04_lambda_expressions/lambda_expressions.v)_

### Lesson: Lambda Expressions

V supports **Lambda Expressions**, which are lightweight, inline anonymous functions defined using the `|variables| expression` syntax.

Key architectural characteristics:

1. **Scope Restriction**: Lambda expressions are not general-purpose functions; this syntax is **only** valid when passed directly as arguments to higher-order functions like `.sort()`, `.map()`, and `.filter()`.
2. **Implicit Returns**: The result of the single expression on the right-hand side is automatically returned. No `return` keyword is needed.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Sorting (`nums.sort(|a, b| b < a)`)**:
  The `.sort()` method accepts a comparator callback. The lambda expression defines parameters `a` and `b`, returning the comparison `b < a` to sort the array in descending order.
- **Mapping (`nums.map(|x| x * 10)`)**:
  The `.map()` method transforms each array element. The lambda `|x| x * 10` accepts the element `x`, multiplies it by `10`, and produces the new mapped array.
- **Filtering (`doubled.filter(|x| x > 20)`)**:
  The `.filter()` method checks a predicate. The lambda `|x| x > 20` checks each element and retains only those returning `true`.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **lambda expressions**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	mut nums := [1, 3, 2, 5, 4]

	// Sort descending using a lambda expression
	nums.sort(|a, b| b < a)
	println('Sorted: ${nums}') // [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

	// Map using lambda to multiply by 10
	doubled := nums.map(|x| x * 10)
	println('Doubled: ${doubled}') // [50, 40, 30, 20, 10]

	// Filter using lambda to keep only elements > 20
	filtered := doubled.filter(|x| x > 20)
	println('Filtered (>20): ${filtered}') // [50, 40, 30]
}
```

---

### Closures

_File location: [functions/01_function_types/05_closures/closures.v](functions/01_function_types/05_closures/closures.v)_

### Lesson: Closures

V supports **Closures**, which are anonymous functions that "remember" and access variables from the parent scope in which they were created.

Unlike languages where variable capture is automatic and hidden, V implements **explicit capture lists** for safety and predictability:

1. **Explicit Capture Syntax**: Captured variables must be declared inside square brackets `fn [captured_var] (args)`.
2. **Pass-by-Value Capture (`[captured_var]`)**: The variable's value is copied when the closure is created. It is read-only inside the closure body.
3. **Pass-by-Reference Capture (`[mut captured_var]`)**: Prepending the capture with `mut` passes the variable by reference. Any changes made to the variable inside the closure modify the original variable in the parent scope, and vice-versa.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **`new_counter` Function**: Returns a closure `fn () int`.
- **State Preservation (`[mut count]`)**: The closure captures the local variable `count` from `new_counter` as `mut`. This allows `count` to survive after `new_counter` returns and update its state across multiple invocation calls (e.g. `counter()`).
- **Value Capture (`[factor]`)**: The closure `multiplier` captures the `factor` variable as read-only. Calling `multiplier(5)` evaluates to `5 * 10` (50).

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **closures**.

```v
module main

fn new_counter() fn () int {
	mut count := 0
	// The closure inherits `count` by reference (read-write) using explicit list `[mut count]`
	return fn [mut count] () int {
		count++
		return count
	}
}

fn main() {
	counter := new_counter()
	println(counter()) // 1
	println(counter()) // 2
	println(counter()) // 3

	// An immutable capture closure
	factor := 10
	multiplier := fn [factor] (x int) int {
		return x * factor
	}
	println(multiplier(5)) // 50
}
```

### Methods For Struct

_File location: [structs/04_methods_for_struct/01_methods_for_struct/01_methods_for_struct.v](structs/04_methods_for_struct/01_methods_for_struct/01_methods_for_struct.v)_

### Lesson: Methods For Struct

A **struct** is a user-defined custom type that groups related variables (called fields) together. Structs are fundamental to V's object-oriented programming model. By default, struct fields are private and immutable. V provides access modifiers like `mut:`, `pub:`, and `pub mut:` to control field access and mutability.

This lesson demonstrates defining structs, updating fields, required fields, default values, and value receiver methods.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **methods for struct**.

```v
module main

import time

// 1. Define a Struct.
// Structs are defined with the `struct` keyword. By default, structs are private
// (only accessible within the current module) and all fields are immutable.
// The `pub` keyword makes the struct visible to other modules.
pub struct Note {
// 2. Struct Access Modifiers:
// - `pub:` makes the fields readable from outside the module, but still immutable.
pub:
	id      int
	// Fields can have default values assigned at declaration.
	created time.Time = time.now()

// - `pub mut:` makes the fields readable and writable from outside the module.
pub mut:
	// Attributes can be attached to struct fields.
	// `@[required]` specifies that this field must be explicitly provided when instantiating.
	message string @[required]
	status  bool
	due     time.Time = time.now().add_days(1)
}

// 3. Define a Method (Value Receiver).
// In V, a method is a function with a receiver argument.
// The receiver is specified in parentheses before the function name: `(n Note)`.
// This is a "value receiver" method, meaning it receives a copy of the struct instance.
// It cannot modify fields on the original struct instance.
pub fn (n Note) is_empty_message() bool {
	return n.message.len < 1
}

fn main() {
	// 4. Instantiate a Struct.
	// We use the struct name and curly braces, listing field initializations.
	// Because `message` is marked `@[required]`, we must specify it.
	// The variable `n` is marked `mut` because we might want to update its `pub mut` fields.
	mut n := Note{
		id:      1
		message: ''
	}

	// 5. Invoke Struct Methods.
	// Methods are called on struct instances using the dot operator.
	if n.is_empty_message() {
		println('message is empty')
	} else {
		println('message not empty')
	}
}
```

### Mutable Methods

_File location: [structs/04_methods_for_struct/02_mutable_methods/02_mutable_methods.v](structs/04_methods_for_struct/02_mutable_methods/02_mutable_methods.v)_

### Lesson: Mutable Methods

By default, struct methods in V receive a read-only copy of the struct instance (value receiver). If a method needs to modify any fields of the struct, it must declare a mutable receiver using the `mut` keyword, e.g., `fn (mut n Note) mark_as_completed()`.

Additionally, the struct instance variable must be declared with `mut` at the call site to allow mutable method invocations.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **mutable methods for struct**.

```v
module main

import time

pub struct Note {
pub:
	id      int
	created time.Time = time.now()
pub mut:
	message string @[required]
	status  bool
	due     time.Time = time.now().add_days(1)
}

// 1. Define a Mutable Struct Method.
// To modify fields of a struct inside a method, the receiver must be marked mutable: `(mut n Note)`.
// Under the hood, this passes a pointer/mutable reference, allowing the method to update
// the original struct instance fields directly.
pub fn (mut n Note) mark_as_completed() {
	n.status = true
	println('Note [ID: ${n.id}] marked as completed.')
}

// 2. Define another Mutable Method to update the message.
pub fn (mut n Note) update_message(new_msg string) {
	if new_msg.len > 0 {
		n.message = new_msg
		println('Note [ID: ${n.id}] message updated to: "${new_msg}"')
	}
}

fn main() {
	// 3. Instantiate a mutable struct instance.
	// To call mutable methods on a struct, the variable MUST be declared as mutable (`mut`).
	// If `n` was immutable, calling `n.mark_as_completed()` would result in a compilation error.
	mut n := Note{
		id:      42
		message: 'Learn V programming'
		status:  false
	}

	println('Initial state - Message: "${n.message}", Completed: ${n.status}')

	// 4. Call the mutable methods.
	n.update_message('Master V programming and C interop!')
	n.mark_as_completed()

	// 5. Verify the updates.
	println('Final state - Message: "${n.message}", Completed: ${n.status}')
	assert n.status == true
}
```

### Lesson: Printing Custom Types

If you want to define a custom print value for your type, simply define a `str()` string method:

```v
module main

struct Color {
	r int
	g int
	b int
}

pub fn (c Color) str() string {
	return '{${c.r}, ${c.g}, ${c.b}}'
}

fn main() {
	red := Color{
		r: 255
		g: 0
		b: 0
	}
	println(red)
}
```

### Anonymous Structs

_File location: [structs/07_anonymous_structs/anonymous_structs.v](structs/07_anonymous_structs/anonymous_structs.v)_

### Lesson: Anonymous Structs

V supports **Anonymous Structs** which are inline struct declarations without separate struct names. They are useful for one-off structures like local nested objects.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Inline Sub-Struct Declaration**:
  In the `Book` struct definition, the `author` field is declared as an anonymous struct type with fields `name string` and `age int`. No named struct like `Author` is required.
- **Inline Struct Initialization**:
  Inside `main()`, we instantiate `Book`. The nested `author` field is initialized directly using `struct { name: 'Samantha Black', age: 24 }`, matching the field structure.
- **Field Access**:
  Nested fields are accessed sequentially using dot notation: `book.author.name` and `book.author.age`.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **anonymous structs**.

```v
module main

import json

struct Book {
	title string
mut:
	author struct {
		name string
	mut:
		age int
	}
}

fn main() {
	mut book := Book{
		title:  'The V Programming Language'
		author: struct {
			name: 'Samantha Black'
			age:  24
		}
	}
	book.author.age = 25
	println('${book.title} by ${book.author.name} (${book.author.age})')
	println(json.encode(book))
}
```

### Static Type Methods

_File location: [structs/08_static_type_methods/static_type_methods.v](structs/08_static_type_methods/static_type_methods.v)_

### Lesson: Static Type Methods

V supports **Static Type Methods** (e.g. `User.new()`). These are defined on a struct via `fn [StructName].[methodName]` and allow organizing all constructor/factory functions related to a struct. V does not have traditional class constructors; static type methods are standard functions namespace-associated with the struct.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Static Method Definition**:
  `fn User.new(name string, age int) User` declares a static method named `new` associated with the `User` struct namespace. It returns a new `User` instance.
- **Factory Organization**:
  The static method `User.default_user()` calls `User.new('Guest', 18)` to construct a user with default values, acting as a clean factory builder.
- **Invocation Syntax**:
  Inside `main()`, static methods are invoked using the struct name prefix: `User.new(...)` and `User.default_user()`. This prevents global namespace pollution and groups constructor-like logic cleanly.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **static type methods**.

```v
module main

struct User {
	name string
	age  int
}

// Defining a static type method on User
fn User.new(name string, age int) User {
	return User{
		name: name
		age:  age
	}
}

// Another static method
fn User.default_user() User {
	return User.new('Guest', 18)
}

fn main() {
	// Call static type methods using StructName.method_name()
	user1 := User.new('Bob', 25)
	user2 := User.default_user()

	println('User 1: ${user1.name}, Age: ${user1.age}')
	println('User 2: ${user2.name}, Age: ${user2.age}')
}
```

### noinit Structs

_File location: [structs/09_noinit_structs/noinit_structs.v](structs/09_noinit_structs/noinit_structs.v)_

### Lesson: noinit Structs

V supports `[noinit]` structs which are structs that cannot be initialized directly outside of their declaring module. This forces client code to use factory constructor functions to instantiate the struct, enabling strict initialization checks and API boundaries.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Declaring [noinit]**:
  In the `noinit_config` module (`noinit_config.v`), the `Config` struct is marked with the `@[noinit]` attribute. This blocks external modules from directly initializing it using literals like `noinit_config.Config{ ... }`.
- **Exposing a Constructor**:
  We provide a public factory function `pub fn new_config(port int, host string) Config` inside the `noinit_config` module, which is authorized to initialize and return the struct.
- **Compiler Enforcement**:
  In the main module (`noinit_structs.v`), creating `noinit_config.new_config(...)` compiles and runs successfully. Attempting to directly write `noinit_config.Config{port: 8080}` would cause a compilation error.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **noinit structs**.

```v
module noinit_config

@[noinit]
pub struct Config {
pub:
	port int
	host string
}

// Public constructor function to allow initialization from outside
pub fn new_config(port int, host string) Config {
	return Config{
		port: port
		host: host
	}
}
```

```v
import noinit_config

fn main() {
	// This works because it uses the constructor function
	cfg := noinit_config.new_config(8080, 'localhost')
	println('Config port: ${cfg.port}, host: ${cfg.host}')

	// This would fail compilation because noinit_config.Config is marked [noinit]:
	// cfg2 := noinit_config.Config{ port: 8080, host: 'localhost' }
}
```

### Unions

_File location: [structs/10_unions/unions.v](structs/10_unions/unions.v)_

### Lesson: Unions

A **Union** is a special type of struct that allows storing different data types in the same memory location. The largest member defines the size of the union. All members share the same memory location, meaning modifying one member automatically modifies the shared representation of the others. Union field access is considered memory-unsafe and must always be performed inside `unsafe {}` blocks.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Union Declaration & Mutability**:
  `union Data` declares two fields: `f f64` (8 bytes) and `i int` (4 bytes). Because they are in a union, they share the same starting memory address, and the total size of `Data` is 8 bytes. By default in V, union fields are immutable; we must place them under a `mut:` block inside the union declaration to allow their values to be reassigned.
- **Memory Corruption Demonstration**:
  We initialize the union with an integer `i: 10`.
  Inside `unsafe { ... }`, when we assign `d.f = 5.5`, the float value overwrites the shared memory. Reading `d.i` subsequently returns a garbled integer representing the binary layout of the float `5.5`, demonstrating the shared storage layout.
- **Safety Restriction**:
  Accessing any field of a union (`d.i` or `d.f`) is blocked by the compiler unless wrapped in an `unsafe` block, protecting developers from accidental memory misinterpretation.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **unions**.

```v
module main

// Define a union sharing the same memory location, marked mutable
union Data {
mut:
	f f64
	i int
}

fn main() {
	mut d := Data{
		i: 10
	}

	// Accessing union members must be performed in an unsafe block
	unsafe {
		println('Union int value: ${d.i}')

		// Modifying one member automatically modifies the other since they share memory
		d.f = 5.5
		println('Union float value: ${d.f}')
		println('Union int value after float update: ${d.i} (shared memory representation)')
	}
}
```

# Chapter 8: Error Handling

## Quick Access

Below is an index of all code examples in this chapter. You can use these links to jump directly to any specific code example:

**Option & Result Types**

- [Error Handling](#error-handling)

V has no exceptions. Instead, it handles errors using **Option** and **Result** types, which are checked at compile time. This chapter teaches you how to write robust, error-free programs using V's clean error handling syntax.

## Option & Result Types

### Error Handling

_File location: [error_handling/error_handling.v](error_handling/error_handling.v)_

In many programming languages, errors are handled using exceptions (with `try`, `catch`, and `throw` blocks). Exception blocks can make code hard to read and trace because control flow can jump unpredictably.

V takes a different approach. **V does not have exceptions.** Instead, V handles errors explicitly using two main concepts:

- **Option Types (`?T`)**: Used when a value might simply be missing (like searching for an item that isn't in a list).
- **Result Types (`!T`)**: Used when an operation might actually fail with a specific error (like division by zero or a database timeout).

By forcing you to handle these outcomes explicitly, V makes your code safer and easier to debug.

}
```

### Deep Dive Explanation

#### 1. Option (`?T`) vs. Result (`!T`) Types

V enforces safety by separating missing data from actual runtime failures at the type system level:

- **Option Type (`?T`)**: Declares that a variable or function return value can either hold a value of type `T` or `none` (denoting absence). Use options for operations like lookups or querying optional attributes.
- **Result Type (`!T`)**: Declares that an operation returns either a value of type `T` or an error that implements the `IError` interface. Use results for operations that can fail due to external factors (e.g., IO, math division, DB connection).

#### 2. Unwrapping with the `or` Block

When invoking a function that returns an Option or a Result, V requires you to explicitly unwrap it using an `or` block:

```v
value := maybe_value() or { fallback_value }
```

The `or` block acts as a recovery scope and **must** adhere to one of the following two rules:

1. **Provide a Fallback Value**: It must evaluate to an expression matching type `T`.
2. **Halt or Divert Control Flow**: It must use keywords like `return`, `panic()`, `exit()`, `break`, or `continue` to exit the current scope.

For functions returning a Result type, V automatically exposes an implicit variable named `err` (of type `IError`) inside the `or` block. You can call `err.msg()` or `err.code()` to inspect the failure:

```v
result := divide(10.0, 0.0) or {
    println('Math error: ' + err.msg())
    0.0
}
```

#### 3. Error and Option Propagation

Instead of handling errors immediately with an `or` block, you can bubble them up to the caller using propagation suffixes:

- Use the **`?`** suffix to propagate `none` from an optional-returning function:
  ```v
  item := find_item(id)? // Returns none to the caller if find_item fails
  ```
- Use the **`!`** suffix to propagate errors from a result-returning function:
  ```v
  res := divide(a, b)! // Propagates the IError up to the caller if b == 0.0
  ```
  _Note: A function can only use the propagation suffix if its own return type matches (i.e., returns `?U` or `!U` respectively)._

#### 4. Custom Error Structs and the `IError` Interface

To build custom error types, define a struct and embed the builtin `Error` struct. Embedding `Error` ensures your custom struct implements the `IError` interface:

```v
struct CustomError {
    Error       // Embed standard Error fields and methods
    message string
    code    int
}
```

You can override the `msg()` and `code()` methods to define how the error is printed and what status code it carries.

#### 5. Type Assertions and Smart Casting with `is`

When handling generic `IError` values inside an `or` block, you can query their concrete types using the `is` keyword:

```v
fetch_data(false) or {
    if err is CustomError {
        // V smart-casts 'err' to CustomError here
        println('Custom code: ${err.code}')
    }
    ''
}
```

If the type check matches, V automatically smart-casts `err` inside that block, allowing you to access custom fields (like `code` or `query`) without explicit casting.

Modules help organize larger codebases. In this chapter, you will learn how to create modules, import them, manage member visibility using `pub`, and understand module initialization lifecycle.

## Modules & Project Structure

### Creating a Simple V Project - Main (modulebasics.v)

_File location: [modules/ch01_creating_simple_v_project/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch01_creating_simple_v_project/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

### Lesson: Creating a Simple V Project

Think of a module as a small toolbox. The `main` module is the entry point of your program, while other modules can hold reusable functions and types.

This first example is intentionally simple: it shows the structure of a single-file V program before we introduce imports and shared modules.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	println('Hello World!')
}
```

---

### Creating a Module - Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch02_creating_modue/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch02_creating_modue/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: A Reusable Helper Module

A module can hold functions that other parts of your program can reuse. In this example, the helper module `mod1` exposes a public function called `greet`.

```v
module mod1

pub fn hello() {
	println('Hello from mod1!')
}
```

---

### Creating a Module - Main (modulebasics.v)

_File location: [modules/ch02_creating_modue/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch02_creating_modue/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

### Lesson: Module Main Entry

This file acts as the application entry point. It imports the helper module and calls one of its public functions.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	println('Hello World!')
}
```

---

### Importing a Module - Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch03_importing_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch03_importing_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Imported Module Helper

Importing a module gives your program access to its public members. The module name becomes the namespace you use when calling those functions.

```v
module mod1

pub fn hello() {
	println('Hello from mod1!')
}
```

---

### Importing a Module - Main (modulebasics.v)

_File location: [modules/ch03_importing_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch03_importing_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

### Lesson: Imported Module Main

The main program can now use the imported module without copying its code into the entry file.

```v
module main

import mod1

fn main() {
	println('Hello World!')
}
```

---

### Accessing Module Members - Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch04_accessing_members_of_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch04_accessing_members_of_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Public vs Private Members

Not everything in a module should be accessible from outside. In V, `pub` makes a function available to other modules, while private functions stay inside the module.

```v
module mod1

pub fn hello() {
	println('Hello from mod1!')
}
```

---

### Accessing Module Members - Main (modulebasics.v)

_File location: [modules/ch04_accessing_members_of_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch04_accessing_members_of_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

### Lesson: Member Visibility Main

From the main program, you can call the public function, but private helpers remain hidden.

```v
module main

import mod1

fn main() {
	mod1.hello()
	println('Hello World!')
}
```

---

### Multiple Files (After Refactoring) - Helper 1 (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch05_working_with_multiple_files_in_module/after/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch05_working_with_multiple_files_in_module/after/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Multiple Files (After Refactoring) - Helper 1

A single module can be split across several files. This makes it easier to keep related helpers organized without changing how the module is imported.

```v
module mod1

pub fn hello() {
	println('Hello from mod1!')
}
```

---

### Multiple Files (After Refactoring) - Helper 2 (file2.v)

_File location: [modules/ch05_working_with_multiple_files_in_module/after/modulebasics/mod1/file2.v](modules/ch05_working_with_multiple_files_in_module/after/modulebasics/mod1/file2.v)_

### Lesson: Multiple Files (After Refactoring) - Helper 2

The second file in the same module can hold additional helper functions. The module still behaves as one logical unit when imported.

```v
module mod1

fn hello2() {
	println('Hello 2 from mod1!')
}
```

---

### Multiple Files (After Refactoring) - Main (modulebasics.v)

_File location: [modules/ch05_working_with_multiple_files_in_module/after/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch05_working_with_multiple_files_in_module/after/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

_File location: [modules/ch06_member_scope_in_module/after/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch06_member_scope_in_module/after/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Member Scope (After Refactoring) - Helper 1

A function marked `pub` can be called from outside the module, while a private helper can still be used by other functions inside the same module.

```v
module mod1

pub fn hello() {
	println('Hello from mod1!')
	// hello2 is not a public but accessible within mod1
	hello2()
}
```

---

### Member Scope (After Refactoring) - Helper 2 (file2.v)

### Cyclic Imports - Module 1 Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch07_cyclic_imports/modulebasics/m1/file1.v](modules/ch07_cyclic_imports/modulebasics/m1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Cyclic Imports - Module 1

This example shows a circular dependency between two modules. In practice, you should avoid this pattern because it makes the import graph harder to reason about.

```v
module m1

import m2

pub const greet_from_m1 = 'Greetings from m1'

pub fn hello() {
	println(m2.greet_from_m2)
}
```

---

### Cyclic Imports - Module 2 Helper (file1.v)

### Module Init & Cleanup Functions - Config (config.v)

_File location: [modules/ch08_init_function_for_module/modulebasics/config/config.v](modules/ch08_init_function_for_module/modulebasics/config/config.v)_

### Lesson: Transitive Initialization Helper

V modules support lifecycle hooks for setting up and tearing down resources. A module's `init()` function runs when it is first imported, and its `cleanup()` function runs when the program terminates.

In this helper module `config`, we define simple hooks to simulate loading configuration details.

```v
module config

pub const version = '1.0.0'

fn init() {
	println('Initializing config module...')
}

fn cleanup() {
	println('Cleaning up config module...')
}
```

---

### Module Init & Cleanup Functions - Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch08_init_function_for_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch08_init_function_for_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Module Init & Cleanup Functions Helper

This helper module `mod1` imports `config`, simulates the initialization/release of a C library wrapper, and exposes a public function `hello()`.

- **`init()`**: A special private function (`fn init()`) that runs automatically when a module is first imported. It is ideal for one-time initialization, such as preparing C libraries or setting up state.
- **`cleanup()`**: A special private function (`fn cleanup()`) that executes automatically when the program terminates. It runs in the reverse order of the `init()` calls, making it perfect for releasing C library resources or flushing files.

```v
module mod1

import config

pub fn hello() {
	println('Hello from mod1! (using config v${config.version})')
}

fn init() {
	println('Initializing mod1 module (C library stub initialized)...')
}

fn cleanup() {
	println('Cleaning up mod1 module (C library stub released)...')
}
```

---

### Module Init & Cleanup Functions - Main (modulebasics.v)

_File location: [modules/ch08_init_function_for_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch08_init_function_for_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

### Lesson: Module Init & Cleanup Functions

V is designed to be highly modular. Here is a summary of the core rules governing V modules, and how the program executes:

#### 1. Module Basics & Organization

- **Scope:** Every file in a directory belongs to the same module. If no module name is specified at the top of the file, it defaults to `main`.
- **Visibility:** All elements (structs, functions, constants, etc.) inside a module are visible across all files of that same module, regardless of whether they are marked with `pub`.
- **Names:** Module names must be short (ideally under 10 characters) and written in `snake_case`.
- **Circular Imports:** Circular imports are strictly forbidden.

#### 2. Module Lookup & `v.mod`

- V uses `v.mod` files as lookup anchors.
- The directory containing the nearest `v.mod` file is prepended to V's module search path. This enables projects to easily import submodules (e.g. `import myapp.common`) using relative structure anchors.

#### 3. Special Prototyping Rules for Project Roots

- For the top-level project folder (compiled with `v .`), you can have multiple `.v` files belonging to different modules (like `module main` and `module abc`) in the same directory.
- This is a special rule designed to ease prototyping, allowing you to split files easily before moving them to separate directory submodules. In any other non-root directory, all `.v` files must declare the exact same module name matching the folder name.

#### 4. Lifecycle Hooks (`init` & `cleanup`)

- Neither `init()` nor `cleanup()` can be made public (`pub`).
- **Single Execution:** V calls `init()` exactly once when the module is imported, regardless of how many other modules transitively or directly import it. For example, `config` is imported by both `mod1` and `main`, but its `init()` runs only once.
- **Reverse-Order Execution:** V calls `cleanup()` automatically once at the end of program execution, in the exact reverse order of their `init()` invocations.

```v
module main

import mod1
import config

fn main() {
	println('Main function started.')
	mod1.hello()
	println('Using config directly in main: v${config.version}')
	println('Main function ending.')
}
```

---

### Accessing Module Constants - Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch09_accessing_constants_of_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch09_accessing_constants_of_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Accessing Module Constants Helper

Constants are shared values that belong to a module. They are great for configuration strings or fixed messages that multiple files can use.

```v
module mod1

pub const greet_msg = 'Greeting from mod1!'
```

---

### Accessing Module Constants - Main (modulebasics.v)

_File location: [modules/ch09_accessing_constants_of_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch09_accessing_constants_of_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

### Lesson: Accessing Module Constants

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **modulebasics**.

```v
module main

import mod1

fn main() {
	println(mod1.greet_msg)
}
```

---

### Accessing Module Structs - Helper (file1.v)

_File location: [modules/ch10_accessing_structs_and_embedded_structs_of_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v](modules/ch10_accessing_structs_and_embedded_structs_of_module/modulebasics/mod1/file1.v)_

### Lesson: Accessing Module Structs Helper

A **struct** is a user-defined custom type that groups related variables (called fields) together. Structs are fundamental to V's object-oriented programming model. By default, struct fields are private and immutable. V provides access modifiers like `mut:`, `pub:`, and `pub mut:` to control field access and mutability.

These examples demonstrate defining structs, updating fields, required fields, default values, and struct methods.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **file1**.

```v
module mod1

import time

// NoteTimeInfo is a struct to store time info of Note
pub struct NoteTimeInfo {
pub:
	created time.Time = time.now()
pub mut:
	due time.Time = time.now().add_days(1)
}

// Note is a struct with embedding struct NoteTimeInfo along with other fields
pub struct Note {
	NoteTimeInfo // Embedded Struct
pub:
	id int
pub mut:
	message string @[required]
	status  bool
}
```

---

_File location: [modules/ch10_accessing_structs_and_embedded_structs_of_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v](modules/ch10_accessing_structs_and_embedded_structs_of_module/modulebasics/modulebasics.v)_

### Lesson: Accessing Module Structs

A **struct** is a user-defined custom type that groups related variables (called fields) together. Structs are fundamental to V's object-oriented programming model. By default, struct fields are private and immutable. V provides access modifiers like `mut:`, `pub:`, and `pub mut:` to control field access and mutability.

These examples demonstrate defining structs, updating fields, required fields, default values, and struct methods.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **modulebasics**.

```v
module main

import mod1

fn main() {
	n := mod1.Note{
		id:      1
		message: 'Accessing structs of module demo'
	}
	println('Accessing struct field value Note id: ${n.id}')
	println('Accessing embedded struct field value NoteTimeInfo: ${n.NoteTimeInfo}')
}
```

## Installing External Packages

V has a built-in package manager called `vpm` (V Package Manager) that allows you to easily install, update, and manage third-party modules. External packages are hosted on the official V registry at [vpm.vlang.io](https://vpm.vlang.io).

### How to Install Packages with vpm

To install a package, use the `v install` command followed by the package identifier (usually in the format `author.package_name`):

```bash
v install xiusin.vredis
```

This downloads the package and installs it into the V modules directory (typically located at `~/.vmodules/` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Users\Username\.vmodules\` on Windows).

### Common vpm Commands

- **Install a package:**
  ```bash
  v install author.package_name
  ```
- **Install from a Git repository directly:**
  ```bash
  v install https://github.com/author/package_name
  ```
- **Update an installed package:**
  ```bash
  v update author.package_name
  ```
- **Remove/uninstall a package:**
  ```bash
  v remove author.package_name
  ```
- **Search for packages:**
  ```bash
  v search query
  ```

### Importing and Using External Packages

Once a package is installed via `vpm`, you can import it in your V code just like a standard library module:

```v
import xiusin.vredis

fn main() {
	// Code utilizing the external redis package
}
```

---

### Redis Console Demo

_File location: [modules/ch11_install_external_packages_and_webview/redis_console_demo/redis_console_demo.v](modules/ch11_install_external_packages_and_webview/redis_console_demo/redis_console_demo.v)_

This example demonstrates how to use the external `xiusin.vredis` client package in a console application and demonstrates key namespacing with the custom `NamespacedRedis` helper. It covers:

- Establishing a connection and handling errors gracefully.
- Basic String operations (`set`, `get`, `incr`, `expire`, `ttl`, `del`).
- List operations (`rpush`, `llen`, `lrange`, `lpop`).
- Hash operations (`hset`, `hget`, `hgetall`).
- Set operations (`sadd`, `sismember`, `smembers`).
- Namespaced Redis helper operations using `NamespacedRedis`.
- Cleaning up created keys on application exit.

This helper provides a namespaced wrapper struct `NamespacedRedis` that automatically prefixes all Redis keys with a given namespace (e.g. `namespace:key`). This is a great pattern for keeping keys organized and avoiding collisions between multiple apps/environments.

```v
module main

import xiusin.vredis

// NamespacedRedis wraps a standard vredis.Redis client and prefixes all keys with a namespace.
// This simplifies multi-tenant or multi-app key separation.
struct NamespacedRedis {

	nr.client.set(nr.key(key), val)!
}

// get retrieves a string value by key.
fn (mut nr NamespacedRedis) get(key string) !string {

}

// del deletes a key.

// --- List Operations ---

// rpush appends a value to a list.

}

// llen returns the length of a list.

}

// --- Hash Operations ---

// hset sets a field in a hash to a value.
fn (mut nr NamespacedRedis) hset(key string, field string, val string) ! {
	nr.client.hset(nr.key(key), field, val)!
}

// hget retrieves a field's value from a hash.
fn (mut nr NamespacedRedis) hget(key string, field string) !string {

}

// hgetall retrieves all fields and values of a hash.
fn (mut nr NamespacedRedis) hgetall(key string) !map[string]string {
	return nr.client.hgetall(nr.key(key))!
}

// --- Set Operations ---

### Packaging Webview as macOS Binaries

### Lesson: Packaging Webview as macOS Binaries

V can run JavaScript, HTML, and CSS under the hood inside its lightweight webview bindings to build impressive cross-platform desktop GUIs. Once your webview-based application is ready to ship, you can package it as a standalone, production-ready macOS app bundle.

To make this seamless, you can use [vlang_macos_webview_app_template](https://github.com/codecaine-zz/vlang_macos_webview_app_template). This is a pure-V template framework featuring a specialized build tool build.vsh that runs native macOS utilities (such as sips and iconutil) to assemble, compile, and structure your app without any Node or Bun JavaScript toolchain requirements.

#### Step-by-Step Packaging Guide

To package your webview app, follow the instructions below:

##### 1. Prerequisites and Installation

Ensure you have the V compiler installed and ttytm.webview registered:

```bash
# Install the webview library
v install ttytm.webview

# Clone the packaging template repository
git clone https://github.com/codecaine-zz/vlang_macos_webview_app_template.git
cd vlang_macos_webview_app_template
```

##### 2. Running Locally under Development

To execute your webview application inline without compilation to verify behaviors:

```bash
v run main.v
```

##### 3. Packaging as a Default macOS App Bundle

To compile main.v with full release-mode optimizations (-prod) and package it using the default name and default wave icon:

```bash
v run build.vsh
```

This compiles your application and structures:

```
dist/Vlang Macos Webview App Template.app
```

##### 4. Custom App Packaging (Custom Name, Icon, and ID)

You can customize the compilation by specifying command flags to customize display names, custom bundle identifiers, and apply any of the 101 built-in glassmorphism workspace icons:

```bash
v run build.vsh main.v --name "My custom App" --icon resources/developer.png --identifier "com.example.myapp"
```

Available build parameters:

- `-i, --icon <path>`: Path to a PNG icon. Defaults to resources/icon.png or icon.png.
- `-n, --name <name>`: Custom display name for the .app bundle wrapper.
- `-d, --identifier <id>`: CFBundleIdentifier mapping (e.g. com.example.id).
- `-v, --version <version>`: App version (defaults to version in v.mod, or 1.0.0).
- `-o, --out <dir>`: Custom destination output directory (defaults to dist).

###### Example building with local premium glassmorphism icons:

```bash
# Build an IDE app using the Developer icon template
v run build.vsh --name "Code Studio" --icon resources/developer.png

# Build a database tool using the Database Admin icon
v run build.vsh --name "DB Browser" --icon resources/database_admin.png

# Build a task planner using the Kanban Board icon
v run build.vsh --name "Task Board" --icon resources/kanban_board.png
```

##### 5. Running the Packaged macOS App

Once built, you can run and distribute your app bundle by:

1. Double-clicking the .app bundle inside Finder (located in the dist/ output directory).
2. Launching it from the terminal:
   ```bash
   open "dist/Vlang Macos Webview App Template.app"
   ```

Using premium templates like this ensures your compiled V webview apps have zero runtime bloat and deliver a sleek, fully native feel matches Apple's premium macOS Sequoia glassmorphism specifications.

V makes concurrent programming easy and safe. This chapter covers spawning threads using `spawn`, communicating safely between threads using channels, and sharing state safely using `shared` and `lock` primitives.

## Channels & Communication

### Unbuffered Channel

_File location: [channels/01_define_channels/01_unbuffered_channel.v](channels/01_define_channels/01_unbuffered_channel.v)_

### Lesson: Unbuffered Channel

Unbuffered channels in V have a capacity of 0. Sending data into an unbuffered channel blocks the sender thread until a receiver thread is ready to pop the data. This provides a strong synchronization point between execution threads.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **unbuffered channel**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	// 1. Declare an unbuffered channel of type 'int'.
	// In V, channels are declared using the `chan` keyword followed by the type.
	// An empty initializer `{}` defaults the capacity (`cap`) to 0.
	uc := chan int{}

	// 2. Query the capacity of the channel.
	// For unbuffered channels, the capacity is always 0.
	// This means any send operation (pushing data) will block the sending thread
	// until another thread is actively reading (popping data) from the channel.
	println('Unbuffered channel capacity: ${uc.cap}') // Outputs: 0

	// 3. Print the type name of the channel.
	// V's `typeof().name` provides runtime type reflection names.
	println('Type of channel: ${typeof(uc).name}') // Outputs: chan int
}
```

---

### Define Buffered Channel (buffered_channel.v)

_File location: [channels/01_define_channels/02_buffered_channel.v](channels/01_define_channels/02_buffered_channel.v)_

### Lesson: Define Buffered Channel

Buffered channels in V are initialized with a specific capacity. The sender thread can push elements into the channel without blocking as long as the buffer is not completely full. Once the buffer is full, subsequent send operations will block until elements are read by another thread.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **buffered channel**.

```v
module main

fn main() {
	// 1. Declare a buffered channel of type 'string' with a capacity of 2.
	// We specify capacity using the `cap` initialization field.
	bc := chan string{cap: 2}

	// 2. Query the capacity of the channel.
	// For buffered channels, this returns the size of the buffer.
	// The sending thread will NOT block when pushing items into the channel
	// until the buffer is completely full (in this case, containing 2 elements).
	println('Buffered channel capacity: ${bc.cap}') // Outputs: 2

	// 3. Print the type name of the channel.
	println('Type of channel: ${typeof(bc).name}') // Outputs: chan string
}
```

---

### Push Buffered

_File location: [channels/02_channel_operations/01_push_buffered.v](channels/02_channel_operations/01_push_buffered.v)_

### Lesson: Push Buffered

V supports lightweight concurrency using **v-routines** via the `spawn` keyword (which spawns a function in a new thread). Threads communicate safely using **channels**, which prevent race conditions. For shared memory concurrency, V provides the `shared` keyword alongside `lock` and `unlock` blocks to safely synchronize access to variables.

These examples cover spawning tasks, reading/writing channels, buffering, select statements, and thread synchronization.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **push buffered**.

```v
fn main() {
	ch := chan int{cap: 1}
	ch <- 51
	println(ch)
}
```

---

### Push Unbuffered

_File location: [channels/02_channel_operations/02_push_unbuffered.v](channels/02_channel_operations/02_push_unbuffered.v)_

### Lesson: Push Unbuffered

V supports lightweight concurrency using **v-routines** via the `spawn` keyword (which spawns a function in a new thread). Threads communicate safely using **channels**, which prevent race conditions. For shared memory concurrency, V provides the `shared` keyword alongside `lock` and `unlock` blocks to safely synchronize access to variables.

These examples cover spawning tasks, reading/writing channels, buffering, select statements, and thread synchronization.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **push unbuffered**.

```v
fn main() {
	ch := chan int{}
	ch <- 51
	println(ch) // doesn't prints, due to blocking behavior of unbuffered channels
}
```

### Pop

_File location: [channels/02_channel_operations/03_pop.v](channels/02_channel_operations/03_pop.v)_

### Lesson: Pop

V supports lightweight concurrency using **v-routines** via the `spawn` keyword (which spawns a function in a new thread). Threads communicate safely using **channels**, which prevent race conditions. For shared memory concurrency, V provides the `shared` keyword alongside `lock` and `unlock` blocks to safely synchronize access to variables.

These examples cover spawning tasks, reading/writing channels, buffering, select statements, and thread synchronization.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **pop**.

```v
fn main() {
	ch := chan int{cap: 1}
	ch <- 51
	println('channel after push: ${ch.str()}')

	println('popping value out of the channel and storing it in immutable variable x')
	x := <-ch
	println('value of x: ${x}')
	println('channel after pop: ${ch.str()}')
}
```

### Deep Dive Explanation: Channels & Basic Operations

#### 1. Unbuffered vs. Buffered Channels

- **Unbuffered Channels (`cap: 0`)**: Initialized via `chan T{}`. They have no intermediate storage. Any send operation (`ch <- value`) blocks the sender until a receiver is ready to pop the data (`<-ch`), and vice versa.
  > [!WARNING]
  > **Deadlock Risk:** In the `Push Unbuffered` example, calling `ch <- 51` in the `main` thread without spawning a concurrent reader thread blocks the program permanently, resulting in a thread deadlock.
- **Buffered Channels (`cap > 0`)**: Initialized via `chan T{cap: N}`. They can hold up to `N` items in a queue. Pushing to a buffered channel does **not** block as long as the current queue size is less than `N`. It only blocks when the buffer is full (`ch.len == N`). Popping blocks only when the buffer is empty (`ch.len == 0`).

#### 2. Channel Operations & Metadata Fields

- **Pushing (`<-`)**: Sends data to the channel. Format: `channel_var <- data`.
- **Popping (`<-`)**: Receives data from the channel. Format: `variable := <-channel_var`.
- **Properties**:
  - `.cap`: The static, defined capacity of the channel (0 for unbuffered).
  - `.len`: The number of currently buffered elements waiting to be popped.
  - `.closed`: A boolean indicating if the channel has been shut down via `close(ch)`.

### Deep Dive Explanation: Advanced Channel Operations & Multiplexing

#### 1. Non-Blocking Senders & Receivers (`try_push` and `try_pop`)

If your program cannot afford to block (e.g., in high-frequency game loops or real-time networking threads), V provides non-blocking channel API methods:

- **`try_push(val)`**: Attempts to send `val` immediately. It returns a `ChanStatus` enum:
  - `.success`: The value was written to the channel's buffer.
  - `.not_ready`: The operation would block (either because the channel is unbuffered with no active reader, or the buffered channel is full).
  - `.closed`: The channel was closed, and writing is invalid.
- **`try_pop(&mut_var)`**: Attempts to read immediately. It takes a reference to a mutable variable where the received value will be stored and returns a `ChanStatus` enum.

#### 2. Channel Multiplexing with `select`

V's `select` statement monitors multiple channel operations simultaneously:

- **Blocking Mode**: The `select` block will halt execution until _at least one_ of the specified channel reads or writes is ready. When a case is ready, its block executes, and control leaves the `select` block.
- **Inactivity Timeouts**: You can declare a timeout block (e.g., `2 * time.second { ... }`). If all other monitored channels remain inactive for that duration, this case triggers. This is highly useful for implementing idle detection or connection timeouts.
- **Non-Blocking Mode (`else`)**: Adding an `else { ... }` block to a `select` statement makes it entirely non-blocking. If no channels are immediately ready, the `else` block executes instantly.

_File location: [concurrency/03_concurrency_real_life_scenario/01_running_multiple_tasks_in_sequence/01_running_multiple_tasks_in_sequence.v](concurrency/03_concurrency_real_life_scenario/01_running_multiple_tasks_in_sequence/01_running_multiple_tasks_in_sequence.v)_

### Lesson: Running Multiple Tasks In Sequence

V supports lightweight concurrency using **v-routines** via the `spawn` keyword (which spawns a function in a new thread). Threads communicate safely using **channels**, which prevent race conditions. For shared memory concurrency, V provides the `shared` keyword alongside `lock` and `unlock` blocks to safely synchronize access to variables.

These examples cover spawning tasks, reading/writing channels, buffering, select statements, and thread synchronization.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **running multiple tasks in sequence**.

```v
module main

import time

fn hot_water() {
	println('Started Switch on Water heater: ${time.now().hhmmss()}')
	time.sleep(5 * time.second)
	println('Water heater indicates hot water ready!: ${time.now().hhmmss()}')
}

fn brush_teeth() {
	println('Started brushing:  ${time.now().hhmmss()}')
	time.sleep(3 * time.second)
	println('End Brushing:  ${time.now().hhmmss()}')
}

fn select_clothes() {
	println('Started choosing pair of clothes :  ${time.now().hhmmss()}')
	time.sleep(3 * time.second)
	println('End choosing pair of clothes:  ${time.now().hhmmss()}')
}

fn main() {
	sw := time.new_stopwatch()
	hot_water()
	brush_teeth()
	select_clothes()
	println('Your pre bath morning chores took: ${sw.elapsed().seconds()} seconds')
}

### Sharing Data Main And Concurrent Tasks

_File location: [concurrency/05_sharing_data_main_and_concurrent_tasks/01_sharing_data_main_and_concurrent_tasks.v](concurrency/05_sharing_data_main_and_concurrent_tasks/01_sharing_data_main_and_concurrent_tasks.v)_

### Lesson: Sharing Data Main And Concurrent Tasks

In addition to channels, V supports shared-memory concurrency using the `shared` keyword. Multiple threads can safely read and write to the same struct using `lock` (exclusive write lock) and `rlock` (shared read lock) blocks. This prevents race conditions and ensures synchronization without manual mutex management.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **sharing data main and concurrent tasks**.

```v
module main

import rand

// 1. Define a shared struct type.
// Structs that are intended to be shared across multiple threads should be defined normally.
// Mutability of fields is indicated as usual (e.g., total and num_donors under mut:).
struct Fund {
	name   string
	target f32
mut:
	total      f32
	num_donors int
}

// 2. Define a method on a shared receiver.
// In V, a receiver can be marked as 'shared' to indicate that the struct instance
// passed to it will be accessed concurrently.
fn (shared f Fund) collect(amt f32) {
	// 3. Acquire a write lock.
	// The `lock` block ensures exclusive (read-write) access to the shared object 'f'.
	// Only one thread can execute within the lock block at a time. Other threads attempting
	// to lock 'f' will block until this block exits.
	lock f {
		if f.total < f.target {
			f.num_donors += 1
			f.total += amt
			// We can safely read and write to the struct fields inside the lock block.
			println('${f.num_donors} \t before: ${f.total - amt} \t funds received: ${amt} \t total: ${f.total}')
		}
	}
}

// donation simulates generating a random donation amount.
fn donation() f32 {
	// rand.f32_in_range returns a result/option type, so we use `or` to handle default.
	return rand.f32_in_range(100.00, 250.00) or { 100.00 }
}

fn main() {
	// 4. Declare a shared variable.
	// The `shared` keyword before the variable name makes it a shared object.
	// Under the hood, V automatically associates a mutex with this object.
	shared fund := Fund{
		name:   'A noble cause'
		target: 1000.00
	}

	for {
		// 5. Acquire a read lock (rlock).
		// A read lock allows multiple threads to read the shared object concurrently
		// but prevents any thread from writing to it.
		rlock fund {
			if fund.total >= fund.target {
				break
			}
		}

		// 6. Spawn concurrent tasks.
		// The `go` keyword (interchangeable with `spawn`) starts a function in a new thread.
		// `go donation()` returns a thread handle `h`.
		h := go donation()

		// Spawning `fund.collect` concurrently and passing the result of `h.wait()`.
		// `h.wait()` blocks the main loop until the `donation()` thread finishes and returns its f32 value.
		go fund.collect(h.wait())
	}

	// 7. Final output with read lock.
	rlock fund {
		println('${fund.num_donors} donors donated for ${fund.name}')
		println('${fund.name} raised total fund amount: \$ ${fund.total}')
	}
}
```

### Deep Dive Explanation: V-Routines & Shared Memory Concurrency

#### 1. Coroutines (V-Routines) via `spawn` and `go`

V supports lightweight concurrency using **v-routines**, which are spawned using the `spawn` keyword (the `go` keyword acts as an alias).

- When you call `spawn task()`, V runs the function concurrently.
- V's runtime schedules these v-routines across an OS thread pool, making them highly efficient and lightweight.

#### 2. Thread Handles & Blocking on `.wait()`

Every `spawn` operation returns a thread handle:

- If the function returns a value of type `T`, the handle has the type `thread T`.
- If the function does not return a value (void), the handle is of type `thread`.
- Calling `.wait()` on a thread handle (e.g., `result := handle.wait()`) blocks the calling thread until the spawned routine completes, retrieving its return value.
- You can manage multiple threads by pushing their handles into an array and waiting on all of them at once:
  ```v
  mut threads := []thread int{}
  threads << spawn worker(1)
  threads << spawn worker(2)
  results := threads.wait() // Returns []int containing results from all workers
  ```

#### 3. Shared State Mutexes (`shared`)

For shared-memory concurrency, V does not allow raw, unsynchronized access to global or heap variables across threads. Instead, variables must be explicitly marked as `shared`:

- `shared fund := Fund{...}` instructs the compiler to automatically associate a mutex with the `fund` instance.
- Struct methods can accept a shared receiver (e.g., `fn (shared f Fund) collect(...)`).

#### 4. Safe Synchronization: `lock` and `rlock` Blocks

To prevent data races, V enforces a strict compile-time lock check. You cannot access or modify a `shared` variable's fields directly. You must wrap the access in a lock block:

- **`lock variable { ... }`**: Acquires an exclusive read-write lock. Use this block whenever you mutate fields of the shared structure. Only one thread can hold this lock at a time.
- **`rlock variable { ... }`**: Acquires a shared read-only lock. Multiple threads can enter an `rlock` block concurrently to read fields, but any thread attempting to acquire a `lock` will be blocked until all readers exit.

	mut j := json.encode(m)
	println(j)

	// Encode the same object with pretty formatting for readability.
	j = json.encode_pretty(m)
	println(j)
}
```

### Deep Dive Explanation: JSON Serialization & Deserialization

#### 1. Compile-Time JSON Parsing

Unlike many languages that rely on slow, runtime reflection to inspect structures, V's compiler generates encoding and decoding code statically at compile time. This ensures extremely fast performance and safety.

#### 2. Decoding JSON (`json.decode`)

- To decode a JSON string, invoke `json.decode(StructName, json_string)`.
- **Result Type Return**: Since incoming JSON strings can be malformed, `json.decode` returns a Result type (`!StructName`). You **must** unwrap it with an `or` block:
  ```v
  user := json.decode(User, raw_json) or {
      println('Failed to parse user JSON: ${err}')
      return
  }
  ```

#### 3. Encoding to JSON (`json.encode`)

- To serialize a V struct instance into a JSON string, invoke `json.encode(instance)`.
- This operation is guaranteed to succeed and returns a standard `string` directly (no `or` block required).

#### 4. Struct JSON Attribute Tags

V provides structural attributes to customize JSON mapping. These are written inside `@[...]` brackets placed on the same line as the field:

- **Custom Naming**: `field string @[json: 'custom_name']` maps the struct field to the `'custom_name'` JSON key.
- **Skip Fields**: `secret string @[json: '-']` prevents the field from being serialized or deserialized.
- **Required Keys**: `id int @[required]` ensures that if the `id` key is missing in the JSON payload, the decoder returns an error.

		year:   2019
	}

	// 1. Encode object to JSON string
	println('Encoding object to JSON...')
	json_str := json.encode(book)
	println('JSON string: ${json_str}')

	// 2. Write JSON string to file
	println('Writing JSON to file "${file_path}"...')
	os.write_file(file_path, json_str) or {
		eprintln('Failed to write file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	// 3. Read JSON string from file
	println('Reading JSON from file "${file_path}"...')
	content := os.read_file(file_path) or {
		eprintln('Failed to read file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	// 4. Decode JSON string back to Book object
	println('Decoding JSON back to object...')
	decoded_book := json.decode(Book, content) or {
		eprintln('Failed to decode JSON: ${err}')

### Json Array Of Objects

_File location: [json_and_orm/01_json/04_json_array_of_objects/json_array_of_objects.v](json_and_orm/01_json/04_json_array_of_objects/json_array_of_objects.v)_

This example demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize an array of objects (structs) to and from JSON, and how to write/read them using the filesystem.

```v
module main

import json
import os

struct Task {
	id    int
	title string
	done  bool
}

fn main() {
	file_path := 'tasks.json'

	// Create an array of objects
	tasks := [
		Task{
			id:    1
			title: 'Read V Guide'
			done:  false
		},
		Task{
			id:    2
			title: 'Write JSON helper examples'
			done:  true
		},
	]

	// 1. Encode array of objects to JSON string
	println('Encoding array of objects to JSON...')
	json_str := json.encode(tasks)
	println('JSON string:\n${json_str}')

	// 2. Write JSON string to file
	println('\nWriting JSON array to file "${file_path}"...')
	os.write_file(file_path, json_str) or {
		eprintln('Failed to write file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	// 3. Read JSON string from file
	println('Reading JSON from file "${file_path}"...')
	content := os.read_file(file_path) or {
		eprintln('Failed to read file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	// 4. Decode JSON string back to an array of Task objects
	println('Decoding JSON back to array of objects...')
	decoded_tasks := json.decode([]Task, content) or {
		eprintln('Failed to decode JSON: ${err}')
		return
	}

	println('Decoded array of tasks successfully!')
	for task in decoded_tasks {
		println('  - Task #${task.id}: "${task.title}" [Done: ${task.done}]')
	}

	// Clean up created file
	os.rm(file_path) or {}
}
```

### Json Map To From File

_File location: [json_and_orm/01_json/05_json_map_to_from_file/json_map_to_from_file.v](json_and_orm/01_json/05_json_map_to_from_file/json_map_to_from_file.v)_

This example demonstrates how to serialize a map structure (`map[string]int`) into a JSON string, write it to a file, read it back, and deserialize it back into a map in V.

```v
module main

import json
import os

fn main() {
	file_path := 'scores.json'

	// Create a map[string]int
	scores := {
		'Alice':   95
		'Bob':     88
		'Charlie': 92
	}

	// 1. Encode map to JSON string
	println('Encoding map to JSON...')
	json_str := json.encode(scores)
	println('JSON string: ${json_str}')

	// 2. Write JSON string to file
	println('Writing map JSON to file "${file_path}"...')
	os.write_file(file_path, json_str) or {
		eprintln('Failed to write file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	// 3. Read JSON string from file
	println('Reading from file "${file_path}"...')
	content := os.read_file(file_path) or {
		eprintln('Failed to read file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	// 4. Decode JSON string back to map[string]int
	println('Decoding JSON back to map...')
	decoded_scores := json.decode(map[string]int, content) or {
		eprintln('Failed to decode map JSON: ${err}')
		return
	}

	println('Decoded map successfully:')
	for k, v in decoded_scores {
		println('  - ${k}: ${v}')
	}

	// Clean up created file
	os.rm(file_path) or {}
}
```

### Json Array To From File

_File location: [json_and_orm/01_json/06_json_array_to_from_file/json_array_to_from_file.v](json_and_orm/01_json/06_json_array_to_from_file/json_array_to_from_file.v)_

This example demonstrates two different methods for reading and writing arrays to/from files in V:

1. **JSON Serialization**: Best for primitive numeric/boolean arrays (e.g. `[]int`).
2. **Raw Line-by-Line (Plain Text)**: Best for string lists (e.g. `[]string`), joining with newlines on write and using V's standard `os.read_lines()` on read.

```v
module main

import json
import os

fn main() {
	// We will show two ways of writing/reading arrays to/from files:
	// Method 1: Using JSON serialization (great for numeric or structured arrays)
	// Method 2: Using raw text line-by-line reading/writing (great for string lists)

	// --- Method 1: JSON Serialization ---
	println('=== Method 1: JSON Serialization ===')
	json_file_path := 'numbers.json'
	numbers := [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

	println('Encoding array to JSON...')
	json_str := json.encode(numbers)
	println('JSON string: ${json_str}')

	println('Writing JSON to file "${json_file_path}"...')
	os.write_file(json_file_path, json_str) or {
		eprintln('Failed to write file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	json_content := os.read_file(json_file_path) or {
		eprintln('Failed to read file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	decoded_numbers := json.decode([]int, json_content) or {
		eprintln('Failed to decode array JSON: ${err}')
		return
	}
	println('Decoded array: ${decoded_numbers}')
	os.rm(json_file_path) or {}

	// --- Method 2: Raw Line-by-Line (Plain Text) ---
	println('\n=== Method 2: Raw Line-by-Line ===')
	text_file_path := 'fruits.txt'
	fruits := ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date']

	println('Writing array elements to text file "${text_file_path}"...')
	// Join the string array with newlines to write line-by-line
	fruits_content := fruits.join('\n')
	os.write_file(text_file_path, fruits_content) or {
		eprintln('Failed to write file: ${err}')
		return
	}

	println('Reading lines from file "${text_file_path}" using os.read_lines()...')
	// os.read_lines reads a file directly into a []string (line by line)
	read_fruits := os.read_lines(text_file_path) or {
		eprintln('Failed to read lines: ${err}')
		return
	}
	println('Read string array: ${read_fruits}')

	// Clean up created files
	os.rm(text_file_path) or {}
}
```

### Orm Demo

### Lesson: Orm Demo

Databases and JSON handling are essential parts of backend development. This lesson on **Orm Demo** details V's built-in JSON utilities or its built-in database ORM.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **orm demo**.

```v
module main

import db.sqlite

@[table: 'Notes']
struct Note {
	id      int    @[primary; sql: serial]
	message string @[sql: 'detail'; unique]
	status  bool
}

fn main() {
	// Establishing a connection to the database

	mut db := sqlite.connect('NotesDB.db') or { panic(err) }
	defer {
		db.close() or {}
	}
	db.exec('drop table if exists Notes') or { panic(err) }

	// Creating a table
	sql db {
		create table Note
	} or { panic(err) }

	// Inserting record(s)
	n1 := Note{
		message: 'Get some milk'
		status:  false
	}

	n2 := Note{
		message: 'Get groceries'
		status:  false
	}
	sql db {
		insert n1 into Note
		insert n2 into Note
	} or { panic(err) }

	println(db.last_id() as int)

	// Select records
	all_notes := sql db {
		select from Note
	} or { panic(err) }

	println(all_notes)

		select from Note order by id desc
	} or { panic(err) }
	println(notes_sorted)

	// Select using the limit clause
	notes_limited := sql db {
		select from Note order by id desc limit 1
	} or { panic(err) }

	println(notes_limited)
	println('Type returned by select when limit is 1:  ${typeof(notes_limited).name}')

	// Select using where clause
	notes_latest := sql db {
		select from Note where id > 1
	} or { panic(err) }

	println(notes_latest)

	// Update record(s)
	sql db {
		update Note set status = true where id == 2
	} or { panic(err) }

	notes_updated := sql db {
		select from Note where id == 2
	} or { panic(err) }
	println(notes_updated)

	// Delete record(s)
	sql db {
		delete from Note where id == 2
	} or { panic(err) }

	notes_leftover := sql db {

	sql db {
		drop table Note
	} or { panic(err) }
	println('Dropped the Note table from database!')
}
```

### Deep Dive Explanation: V's Compile-Safe Database ORM

#### 1. Compile-Time Query Safety

V features a built-in ORM (supporting SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL) that integrates directly with V's type system:

- **The `sql` Block**: All ORM operations are written inside a special `sql db { ... }` block.
- **Type Safety**: The compiler validates table structures, column types, and query logic during compilation. For example, trying to compare a string field to an integer inside the `where` clause will fail to compile.
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: All variables referenced in query clauses (like `where id == id_var`) are automatically treated as query parameters under the hood, making V's ORM immune to SQL injection attacks out of the box.

#### 2. Struct Attributes for ORM Schema Design

You configure your database schema by annotating V structs with attributes:

- **`@[table: 'name']`**: Customizes the table name in the database (defaults to the struct name).
- **`@[primary; sql: serial]`**: Configures the field as an auto-incrementing primary key.
- **`@[sql: 'col_name']`**: Customizes the column name in the database (defaults to the field name).
- **`@[unique]`**: Adds a unique constraint to the column.

#### 3. ORM Operations

- **Create Table**:
  ```v
  sql db { create table Note } or { ... }
  ```
  Generates the SQL DDL statements and creates the table based on the struct fields and attributes.
- **Insert Records**:
  ```v
  sql db { insert n1 into Note } or { ... }
  ```
  Inserts the struct instance into the database. If successful, V updates any auto-incrementing primary keys directly on the passed struct instance.
- **Query Records (`select`)**:
  Queries return a slice of structs (e.g. `[]Note`). Standard SQL clauses are fully supported:
  - `where`: Filter records using standard V boolean operations.
  - `order by`: Sort records (e.g., `order by id desc`).
  - `limit`: Restrict the number of returned records.
  - `offset`: Skip a number of records (used for pagination).
- **Update Records**:
  ```v
  sql db { update Note set status = true where id == 2 } or { ... }
  ```
  Updates the records matching the predicate.
- **Delete Records**:
  ```v
  sql db { delete from Note where id == 2 } or { ... }
  ```
  Deletes the records matching the predicate.

## SQLite Integration

### Sqlite

_File location: [sqlite/sqlite.v](sqlite/sqlite.v)_

### Lesson: Sqlite

Databases and JSON handling are essential parts of backend development. A small SQLite helper module makes your application code cleaner by centralizing connection setup, schema initialization, and CRUD operations in one place.

This example shows a practical pattern you can reuse in small tools, desktop apps, and prototypes:

- connect to a database with a single helper
- enable foreign keys for safer relations
- initialize a table with a reusable setup function
- create, read, update, and delete records with safe parameterized queries
- prevent SQL injection by using `exec_param_many` instead of string interpolation

```v
module sqlite

import db.sqlite as dbsqlite

pub type DB = dbsqlite.DB

pub struct Note {
	id    int
	title string
	body  string
}

pub fn connect(path string) !DB {
	mut db := dbsqlite.connect(path)!
	db.exec('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;') or {
		return error('failed to enable foreign keys: ${err}')
	}
	return db
}

pub fn connect_in_memory() !DB {
	return connect(':memory:')
}

pub fn init_notes_table(mut db DB) ! {
	db.exec('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS notes (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT NOT NULL, body TEXT NOT NULL);') or {
		return error('failed to create notes table: ${err}')
	}
}

pub fn create_note(mut db DB, title string, body string) !int {
	db.exec_param_many('INSERT INTO notes (title, body) VALUES (?, ?);', [title, body]) or {
		return error('failed to insert note: ${err}')
	}
	return db.last_id()
}

pub fn list_notes(mut db DB) ![]Note {
	rows := db.exec('SELECT id, title, body FROM notes ORDER BY id;') or {
		return error('failed to list notes: ${err}')
	}
	mut notes := []Note{}
	for row in rows {
		notes << Note{
			id:    row.vals[0].int()
			title: row.vals[1]
			body:  row.vals[2]
		}
	}
	return notes
}

pub fn update_note(mut db DB, id int, title string, body string) ! {
	db.exec_param_many('UPDATE notes SET title = ?, body = ? WHERE id = ?;', [title, body,
		id.str()]) or { return error('failed to update note: ${err}') }
}

pub fn delete_note(mut db DB, id int) ! {
	db.exec_param_many('DELETE FROM notes WHERE id = ?;', [id.str()]) or {
		return error('failed to delete note: ${err}')
	}
}
```

> [!TIP]
> **Safe database access:** always pass user input as parameters using `exec_param_many` or `exec` with placeholders like `?`. This prevents SQL injection and keeps your queries readable.

### SQLite CRUD Helper

_File location: [sqlite/sqlite_crud.v](sqlite/sqlite_crud.v)_

### Lesson: SQLite CRUD Helper

This template demonstrates a complete SQLite database workflow using raw SQL queries. It includes creating tables, clearing data, inserting records with parameterized inputs to prevent SQL injection, and fetching records into structured types.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Database Connection**: Opening and closing a SQLite database using `sqlite.connect`.
- **Schema Management**: Creating tables dynamically using `db.exec`.
- **Parameterized Queries**: Preventing SQL injection by passing variables inside string arrays using `db.exec_param_many`.
- **Result Mapping**: Manually parsing returned rows into structured V structs.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Appending log files or temporary databases, and deleting them cleanly via `defer` blocks to prevent stray files on disk.

```v
module main

import db.sqlite
import os

struct User {
	id    int
	name  string
	email string
	age   int
}

fn connect_db(path string) !sqlite.DB {
	return sqlite.connect(path)
}

fn init_schema(mut db sqlite.DB) ! {
	db.exec('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE, age INTEGER);') or {
		return error('Could not create table: ${err}')
	}
}

fn reset_users(mut db sqlite.DB) ! {
	db.exec('DELETE FROM users;') or { return error('Could not clear users: ${err}') }
}

fn insert_user(mut db sqlite.DB, name string, email string, age int) !int {
	db.exec_param_many('INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', [
		name,
		email,
		age.str(),
	]) or { return error('Insert failed: ${err}') }
	return db.last_id()
}

fn fetch_users(mut db sqlite.DB) ![]User {
	rows := db.exec('SELECT id, name, email, age FROM users ORDER BY id;') or {
		return error('Select failed: ${err}')
	}
	mut users := []User{}
	for row in rows {
		users << User{
			id:    row.vals[0].int()
			name:  row.vals[1]
			email: row.vals[2]
			age:   row.vals[3].int()
		}
	}
	return users
}

// Reusable CRUD helpers for the SQLite boilerplate example.

fn main() {
	println('=== V SQLite CRUD Boilerplate ===')

	db_path := 'demo.db'
	defer {
		if os.exists(db_path) {
			os.rm(db_path) or {}
			println('Cleaned up temporary database: ${db_path}')
		}
	}

	mut db := connect_db(db_path) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}
	defer {
		db.close() or { eprint('Failed to close database: ${err}') }
	}

	init_schema(mut db) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}

	reset_users(mut db) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}

	user_id := insert_user(mut db, 'Ada', 'ada@example.com', 36) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}
	println('Inserted user id: ${user_id}')

	users := fetch_users(mut db) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}
	for user in users {
		println('User: ${user.id} ${user.name} (${user.email}, age ${user.age})')
	}
}
```

## Sqlite Raw Crud

_File location: [json_and_orm/03_sqlite_raw/sqlite_raw_crud.v](json_and_orm/03_sqlite_raw/sqlite_raw_crud.v)_

This example demonstrates how to connect to a SQLite database and execute raw SQL queries securely using parameterized queries (`db.exec_param_many`) to prevent SQL Injection attacks.

It illustrates:

1. Connecting with `sqlite.connect`.
2. Executing statements that do not return tabular results (like DDL/DML) via `db.exec`.
3. Executing parameterized DML queries (INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE) using `db.exec_param_many` and `?` placeholders.
4. Fetching result sets from `SELECT` statements into `[]sqlite.Row`.
5. Iterating and accessing row values from `row.vals` by index.
6. Handling resource cleanup cleanly via `defer`.

> [!TIP]
> **SQL Injection Prevention:** Avoid raw string interpolation (e.g. `"$name"`) inside raw queries. Using `db.exec_param_many` forces parameter binding, rendering the query secure from malicious inputs.

```v
module main

import db.sqlite

fn main() {
	// 1. Database Connection
	// Connects to a SQLite database. ':memory:' creates a temporary in-memory database.
	println('Connecting to database...')
	mut db := sqlite.connect(':memory:') or {
		println('Connection failed: ${err}')
		return
	}
	defer {
		db.close() or { println('Failed to close database: ${err}') }
		println('Database connection closed.')
	}

	// 2. Schema Creation (DDL)
	println('Creating "users" table...')
	db.exec('CREATE TABLE users (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, name TEXT NOT NULL, email TEXT UNIQUE, age INTEGER);') or {
		println('Table creation failed: ${err}')
		return
	}

	// 3. Create (Insert Records using Parameterized Queries)
	println('\n--- CREATE: Inserting records securely ---')

	// SAFE APPROACH: Use `exec_param_many` with '?' placeholders to prevent SQL Injection.
	// Parameters are passed as an array of strings: []string
	db.exec_param_many('INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', [
		'Alice',
		'alice@example.com',
		'30',
	]) or { println('Insert failed: ${err}') }
	db.exec_param_many('INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', [
		'Bob',
		'bob@example.com',
		'25',
	]) or { println('Insert failed: ${err}') }
	db.exec_param_many('INSERT INTO users (name, email, age) VALUES (?, ?, ?);', [
		'Charlie',
		'charlie@example.com',
		'40',
	]) or { println('Insert failed: ${err}') }

	println('Last inserted row ID: ${db.last_id()}')

	// 4. Read (Select Records using Parameterized Queries)
	println('\n--- READ: Querying records securely ---')

	// Querying with parameters: only retrieve users older than 20
	rows := db.exec_param_many('SELECT id, name, email, age FROM users WHERE age > ?;',
		['20']) or {
		println('Select failed: ${err}')
		[]sqlite.Row{}
	}

	// Iterate and extract column values by index
	for row in rows {
		// Each sqlite.Row has two string arrays: `vals` (values) and `names` (column names)
		id := row.vals[0]
		name := row.vals[1]
		email := row.vals[2]
		age := row.vals[3]
		println('User [ID: ${id}] -> Name: ${name}, Email: ${email}, Age: ${age}')
	}

	// 5. Update (Modify Records using Parameterized Queries)
	println("\n--- UPDATE: Modifying Bob's email and age securely ---")
	db.exec_param_many('UPDATE users SET email = ?, age = ? WHERE name = ?;', [
		'bob_new@example.com',
		'26',
		'Bob',
	]) or { println('Update failed: ${err}') }

	// Verify update
	updated_rows := db.exec_param_many('SELECT email, age FROM users WHERE name = ?;',
		['Bob']) or { []sqlite.Row{} }
	if updated_rows.len > 0 {
		println("Bob's new email: ${updated_rows[0].vals[0]}")
		println("Bob's new age:   ${updated_rows[0].vals[1]}")
	}

	// 6. Delete (Remove Records using Parameterized Queries)
	println('\n--- DELETE: Removing Charlie securely ---')
	db.exec_param_many('DELETE FROM users WHERE name = ?;', ['Charlie']) or {
		println('Delete failed: ${err}')
	}

	// Verify delete
	remaining_rows := db.exec('SELECT name FROM users;') or { []sqlite.Row{} }
	print('Remaining users: ')
	for row in remaining_rows {
		print('${row.vals[0]} ')
	}
	println('')

	// 7. Cleanup
	println('\nDropping "users" table...')
	db.exec('DROP TABLE users;') or { println('Drop table failed: ${err}') }
}
```

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/06_inline_assembly/inline_assembly.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/06_inline_assembly/inline_assembly.v)_

V supports inline assembly block definitions using the `asm` keyword, allowing developers to execute architecture-specific instructions directly from V code. It integrates directly with V variables by mapping them to inputs and outputs using register constraints.

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Write inline assembly blocks targeted at specific architectures (e.g. `arm64` and `amd64`).
2. Utilize V's compile-time conditional block `$if` to compile architecture-specific assembly blocks.
3. Map V variables to assembly inputs and outputs using semicolon constraint annotations (e.g. `; +r (res)`).

```v
module main

// add_five adds 5 to the given integer using inline assembly.
// It uses compile-time conditional checks ($if) to select the correct
// assembly instructions depending on the target CPU architecture.
fn add_five(val int) int {
	mut res := val
	$if arm64 {
		// ARM64 inline assembly for Apple Silicon (macOS M-series) and ARM Linux/Android.
		// - Syntax: add destination, operand1, operand2
		// - Constraints: '; +r (res)' specifies that 'res' is both an input and output register.
		asm arm64 {
			add res, res, 5
			; +r (res)
		}
	} $else $if amd64 {
		// AMD64 (x86_64) inline assembly for Intel/AMD processors.
		// - Syntax: add destination, source
		// - Constraints: '; +r (res)' specifies that 'res' is both an input and output register.
		asm amd64 {
			add res, 5
			; +r (res)
		}
	} $else {
		// Fallback for other architectures (e.g. 32-bit x86, RISC-V, WebAssembly, etc.)
		res += 5
	}
	return res
}

// multiply_by_two multiplies the given integer by 2 using bit shifting in inline assembly.
fn multiply_by_two(val int) int {
	mut res := val
	$if arm64 {
		// ARM64 inline assembly using logical shift left (lsl) by 1 bit.
		asm arm64 {
			lsl res, res, 1
			; +r (res)
		}
	} $else $if amd64 {
		// AMD64 inline assembly using shift arithmetic left (sal).
		asm amd64 {
			sal res, 1
			; +r (res)
		}
	} $else {
		res = res << 1
	}
	return res
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V Inline Assembly (asm) Demo ===')

	// Test 1: Addition using inline assembly
	num := 10
	num_plus_five := add_five(num)
	println('Result of add_five(${num}): ${num_plus_five}')
	assert num_plus_five == 15

	// Test 2: Multiplication (bit-shifting) using inline assembly
	val := 21
	val_double := multiply_by_two(val)
	println('Result of multiply_by_two(${val}): ${val_double}')
	assert val_double == 42

	println('All inline assembly assertions successfully verified!')
}

### C Interop

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/08_c_interop/c_interop.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/08_c_interop/c_interop.v)_

### Lesson: C Interop

V is designed with first-class support for C integration. Since V compiles directly to C, calling C library functions, passing C structs, and compiling legacy C code alongside V is highly performant and requires no heavy wrapper generator.

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Include standard C headers using `#include <header.h>`.
2. Declare C functions using the `fn C.name(args) type` syntax.
3. Map C structures in V using `@[typedef] struct C.name` to represent C typedefs.
4. Interact with C variables, functions, and structs directly from V.

```v
module main

// 1. Include C standard headers.
// V compiles directly to C, so we can use C preprocessor directives like `#include`
// to bring in C standard library definitions or external C headers.
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

// 2. Declare C functions.
// We declare C functions using the `fn C.name(args) return_type` syntax.
// The V compiler translates calls to these functions directly to the native C functions.
fn C.abs(x int) int
fn C.sqrt(x f64) f64

// 3. Declare C Structs.
// V can also interact with C structs. We use `struct C.name` to define them.
// The `@[typedef]` attribute tells the V compiler that `div_t` is a typedef structure
// in C (defined in <stdlib.h>) so it does not prefix it with the `struct` keyword in the C output.
@[typedef]
struct C.div_t {
	quot int
	rem  int
}

// Declare C.div function from stdlib.h which returns a C.div_t struct.
fn C.div(numer int, denom int) C.div_t

fn main() {
	println('=== V C Interop Demo ===')

	// 4. Calling C.abs
	negative_val := -42
	absolute_val := C.abs(negative_val)
	println('C.abs(${negative_val}) = ${absolute_val}')
	assert absolute_val == 42

	// 5. Calling C.sqrt
	float_val := 16.0
	square_root := C.sqrt(float_val)
	println('C.sqrt(${float_val}) = ${square_root}')
	assert square_root == 4.0

	// 6. Working with C Structs and functions returning C Structs
	numerator := 10
	denominator := 3
	div_result := C.div(numerator, denominator)
	println('C.div(${numerator}, ${denominator}) -> Quotient: ${div_result.quot}, Remainder: ${div_result.rem}')
	assert div_result.quot == 3
	assert div_result.rem == 1

	println('All C Interop functions successfully executed and verified!')
}
```

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/23_net_urllib/net_urllib.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/23_net_urllib/net_urllib.v)_

This example demonstrates parsing URLs into components, escaping and unescaping query parameters, and encoding query parameters using the `net.urllib` module.

```v
module main

import net.urllib

fn main() {
	println('=== net.urllib Module Demo ===')

	// 1. Parsing a URL
	raw_url := 'https://user:pass@vlang.io:8080/docs/stdlib?lang=v&version=0.5.1#intro'
	println('Parsing URL: ${raw_url}')

	u := urllib.parse(raw_url) or {
		println('Failed to parse URL: ${err}')
		return
	}

	println('Parsed URL parts:')
	println('  Scheme:   ${u.scheme}')
	println('  Host:     ${u.host}')
	println('  Path:     ${u.path}')
	println('  Query:    ${u.raw_query}')
	println('  Fragment: ${u.fragment}')

	// 2. Query escaping and unescaping
	original_query := 'V compiler version 0.5.1 & details'
	escaped := urllib.query_escape(original_query)
	unescaped := urllib.query_unescape(escaped) or { 'failed' }

	println('\nQuery Escaping:')
	println('  Original:  ${original_query}')
	println('  Escaped:   ${escaped}')
	println('  Unescaped: ${unescaped}')

	// 3. Managing Query Parameters using urllib.Values
	println('\nManaging Query Values:')
	mut query_params := urllib.new_values()
	query_params.add('format', 'json')
	query_params.add('tags', 'programming')
	query_params.add('tags', 'tutorial')
	query_params.set('version', '0.5.1')

	// Encode to raw query string
	encoded_query := query_params.encode()
	println('  Encoded query string: ${encoded_query}')

	// Parse it back
	parsed_params := urllib.parse_query(encoded_query) or { urllib.new_values() }
	println('  Parsed format tag:    ${parsed_params.get('format') or { 'none' }}')
	println('  Parsed tags:          ${parsed_params.get_all('tags')}')
}

This example demonstrates spinning up a local WebSocket server, connecting a WebSocket client to it, exchanging messages, and closing the connection cleanly using the `net.websocket` module.

```v
module main

import net.websocket
import time

fn main() {
	println('=== net.websocket Module Demo ===')

	port := 30099

This example demonstrates implementing JSON-RPC 2.0 servers and clients using V's `net.jsonrpc` module, utilizing a Unix domain socket connection as the transport layer.

```v

This example demonstrates how to build a persistent JSON-RPC 2.0 connection. The server calls `server.start()` to continuously process incoming requests, and the client sends multiple method invocations sequentially over a single socket connection.

```v

### Deep Dive Explanation: Persistent TCP & Custom Protocol Framing

#### 1. Why Message Framing is Essential

TCP is a byte-stream protocol. It does not have any concept of packet or message boundaries; it guarantees only that bytes arrive in order. If a client writes two messages of 100 bytes, the server might read them as a single chunk of 200 bytes, or as several chunks of arbitrary sizes (e.g., 50 and 150 bytes).
To transmit individual messages safely over a persistent connection, we define a custom **Framing Protocol**:

- **Magic Bytes (4 bytes)**: The message starts with a signature (`MSG0` in ASCII). This acts as a sanity check. If the server receives something else, it knows the stream is corrupted or the client is using an incorrect protocol.
- **Length Prefix (4 bytes)**: A big-endian 32-bit integer indicating the exact size of the following payload.
- **Payload**: The actual raw message bytes.

#### 2. Zero-Allocation Chunked Reading (`read_exact`)

The `read_exact(mut conn, size)` function reads bytes in a loop until the full requested size is reached:

```v
n := conn.read(mut data[read_bytes .. read_bytes + chunk_limit])
```

- **Performance Optimization**: Instead of allocating new buffers in each iteration of the loop, V uses slice expressions (`data[start..end]`) to pass a mutable reference to a specific sub-range of the pre-allocated `data` array directly to the socket read function. This avoids any dynamic memory allocation, optimizing throughput and memory usage.

#### 3. Security Boundaries & DoS Protection

Production socket servers must defend against malicious input and network timeouts:

- **Max Payload Checking**: In `read_msg`, the server reads the length prefix from the header. If `len > max_size` (e.g., larger than `8192` bytes), the server immediately rejects the message and closes the connection. Without this check, a client could claim a message size of 2 GB, forcing the server to allocate a huge array and crash due to Out-Of-Memory (OOM).
- **Connection Timeouts**: Calling `conn.set_read_timeout` and `conn.set_write_timeout` prevents threads from blocking indefinitely. If a client connects and then stops sending data (a Slowloris attack), the server will automatically close the socket after the timeout expires (5 seconds in this demo).

}

### Deep Dive Explanation: UDP Packet Fragmentation & Reassembly

#### 1. UDP vs. TCP and the MTU Constraint

Unlike TCP, which handles packet streaming and division transparently, UDP is a datagram-oriented protocol. It sends individual, self-contained packets.

- **Maximum Packet Sizes**: The theoretical maximum size of a UDP packet is 65,535 bytes (including headers), but in practice, any packet larger than the network's **MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)** (typically 1500 bytes on ethernet/internet routers) will be fragmented at the IP layer.
- **Why IP Fragmentation is Bad**: If _any single_ IP fragment is lost during transmission, the entire UDP packet is discarded. This dramatically increases packet loss rates for large payloads.
- **Solution**: Implement **application-level fragmentation**. By splitting payloads into smaller chunks (e.g. 1024 bytes), we ensure each chunk fits comfortably inside a single MTU window, minimizing packet drops.

#### 2. The Custom UDP Fragmentation Protocol

This example implements application-level fragmentation and reassembly using a custom 8-byte header prefix:

- **Protocol ID (`UDP0`)**: 4 bytes to identify valid application packets.
- **Fragment Index (1 byte)**: The sequence index of the current packet (0-indexed).
- **Total Fragments (1 byte)**: The total number of packets that make up the complete message.
- **Fragment Length (2 bytes)**: The size of the payload following this header (max 1024 bytes).

#### 3. Reassembly Mechanics & State Management

Because UDP does not guarantee packet delivery order, packets can arrive out of sequence.

- **State Tracking**: The server uses a `reassemblers` map, keyed by the client's socket address (`addr.str()`). This maps each client to its own `UdpReassembler` structure containing a map of packet indices to their payload bytes.
- **Sequence Ordering**: Once the number of collected fragments matches `total_frags`, the server iterates from `0` to `total_frags - 1` to assemble the payload in the correct order, bypassing any network out-of-order delivery issues.
- **State Cleanup**: As soon as a message is successfully reassembled, `reassemblers.delete(addr_str)` is called. This frees memory immediately and prevents state leak.

#### 4. Safety & DOS Protections

- **Max Fragment Constraints**: The server enforces `max_allowed_fragments := 5` (equivalent to a maximum total message size of ~5 KB). If a packet arrives claiming a higher fragment count, it is discarded immediately to prevent malicious clients from exhausting server memory by flooding it with un-reassemblable data.

### Lesson: Options And Results

V has a very rich and growing standard library and is actively updated. This lesson on **Options And Results** showcases modern standard library packages, system calls, network sockets, inline assembly, or WASM support.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **options and results**.

```v
module main

// Result type (!T) is used when a function can return an error.
fn divide(a f64, b f64) !f64 {
	if b == 0 {
		return error('division by zero')
	}
	return a / b
}

// Option type (?T) is used when a function can return nothing (none).
fn find_user(id int) ?string {
	if id == 1 {
		return 'Alice'
	}
	return none
}

fn main() {
	// 1. Handling a Result type with an `or` block
	// Inside the `or` block, the special variable `err` is available.
	val1 := divide(10.0, 2.0) or {
		println('Error: ${err}')
		0.0
	}
	println('Result 1: ${val1}')

	// 2. Handling a failed Result
	val2 := divide(10.0, 0.0) or {
		println('Error: ${err}')
		0.0
	}
	println('Result 2: ${val2}')

	// 3. Handling an Option type with an `or` block
	// For Option types, the value is unwrapped or the fallback value is returned.
	user1 := find_user(1) or { 'Guest' }
	println('User 1: ${user1}')

	user2 := find_user(99) or { 'Guest' }
	println('User 2: ${user2}')

	// 4. Using if-let syntax to check Options
	if name := find_user(1) {

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **generics**.

```v
module main

// Stack[T] represents a generic stack structure.
struct Stack[T] {
mut:
	items []T
}

// push appends an item of type T to the stack.
fn (mut s Stack[T]) push(item T) {

		return none
	}
	return s.items.pop()
}

// print_val is a generic function that takes any type T and prints it.
fn print_val[T](val T) {
	println('Value: ${val}')
}

fn main() {
	// 1. Using a generic struct with integers

### Compile-Time Directives & Compile-Time Code

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/07_directives/directives.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/07_directives/directives.v)_

### Lesson: Compile-Time Directives & Compile-Time Code

V provides a powerful set of compile-time (or 'comptime') directives and code features, prefixed with `$`. These instructions are evaluated and processed by the compiler during compilation, allowing you to optimize code execution, prune unused branches, dynamically query compilation environment properties, and embed assets directly into the final binary.

#### 1. Conditional Compilation (`$if` Condition)

If you want an `if` expression to be evaluated at compile time, prefix it with `$`. Inactive branches are excluded from compilation entirely, meaning their type checks still occur but no code is generated for them in the final executable.

- **Multiple Conditions:** You can combine multiple platforms or build modes in one branch using logic operators (`||`, `&&`).
- **Expression Usage:** A compile-time `$if` can be used as an expression to conditionally assign values.
- **`$else-$if` Chains:** You can chain compile-time conditions using `$else $if` to check against various compilers, platforms, or custom defines.

##### Builtin `$if` Compilation Target Options

Below is the full list of builtin options supported inside compile-time `$if` conditions:

| OS target                      | Compilers        | Platforms                     | Other                                                    |
| :----------------------------- | :--------------- | :---------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| `windows`, `linux`, `macos`    | `gcc`, `tinyc`   | `amd64`, `arm64`, `aarch64`   | `debug`, `prod`, `test`                                  |
| `darwin`, `ios`, `bsd`         | `clang`, `mingw` | `i386`, `arm32`               | `js`, `glibc`, `prealloc`                                |
| `freebsd`, `openbsd`, `netbsd` | `msvc`           | `rv64`, `rv32`, `s390x`       | `no_bounds_checking`, `freestanding`                     |
| `android`, `mach`, `dragonfly` | `cplusplus`      | `ppc64le`                     | `no_segfault_handler`, `no_backtrace`                    |
| `gnu`, `hpux`, `haiku`, `qnx`  |                  | `x64`, `x32`                  | `no_main`, `fast_math`, `apk`, `threads`                 |
| `solaris`, `termux`            |                  | `little_endian`, `big_endian` | `js_node`, `js_browser`, `js_freestanding`               |
| `serenity`, `vinix`, `plan9`   |                  |                               | `interpreter`, `es5`, `profile`, `wasm32`                |
|                                |                  |                               | `wasm32_emscripten`, `wasm32_wasi`, `native`, `autofree` |

#### 2. Compile-Time Flag Defines (`$d`)

V allows retrieving custom flag values defined via the command line with `-d flag=value` or `-d flag` (which defaults to `-d flag=true`).

- To fetch the flag inside your code, use: `$d('flag_name', default_value)`.
- The `default_value` acts as a fallback when the flag is not provided on the command line. It **must** be a pure literal: booleans (`true`/`false`), integers (`0`), floats (`0.0`), strings (`'string'`), or runes (`\`v\``).
- You can also use `$d('flag_name', false)` inside `$if` conditions (e.g. `$if $d('my_flag', false) { ... }`) to selectively enable or disable blocks of code.
- `$d` can also be used in top-level statements like `#flag` and `#include` (e.g., `#flag linux -I $d('my_include', '/usr')/include`).

#### 3. Compile-Time Warnings & Errors

You can generate custom compile-time messages to warn the developer or abort the build:

- `$compile_warn('message')` prints a warning during compilation but allows the build to continue.
- `$compile_error('message')` immediately halts compilation and prints a custom error.
  These are particularly powerful when combined with platform target checks to enforce compatibility (e.g., aborting compilation on unsupported architectures).

#### 4. Environment Variables (`$env`)

`$env('VAR_NAME')` retrieves the value of an environment variable at compilation time and embeds it as a string literal. It can also be used inside top-level `#flag` and `#include` statements.

#### 5. File Asset Embedding (`$embed_file`)

V can embed the raw content of any external file directly inside the compiled binary using `$embed_file('path')`.

- Returns an `EmbedFileData` structure. Use `.to_string()` or `.to_bytes()` to retrieve contents.
- In production builds (`-prod`), `$embed_file` supports optional on-the-fly compression via `.zlib` (e.g. `$embed_file('x.css', .zlib)`).
- For local development ease, compile with `-d embed_only_metadata`. The file won't be embedded, and V will load the file from disk the first time `data()` is called, permitting external live edits without recompiling.

#### 6. Compile-Time Templates (`$tmpl`)

`$tmpl('path/to/template.html')` compiles and parses a simple template file, interpolating any variables (prefixed with `@` in the template) that exist in the calling scope.

### Lesson: Strings Builder

V has a very rich and growing standard library and is actively updated. This lesson on **Strings Builder** showcases modern standard library packages, system calls, network sockets, inline assembly, or WASM support.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **strings builder**.

```v
module main

import strings

fn main() {
	// 1. Initialize a new Builder with pre-allocated buffer size (e.g. 100 bytes).
	// Pre-allocation is highly recommended for performance to reduce memory allocations.
	mut sb := strings.new_builder(100)

	// 2. Write strings and runes to the buffer
	sb.write_string('Welcome ')
	sb.write_string('to ')
	sb.write_string('the V standard library!')
	sb.write_rune(`\n`)

	sb.write_string('V is:\n')
	features := ['Fast', 'Simple', 'Statically Typed', 'Safe']
	for feature in features {
		sb.write_string('- ')
		sb.write_string(feature)
		sb.write_rune(`\n`)
	}

	// 3. Extract the final constructed string
	result := sb.str()
	println(result)

	// 4. Reset/Clear the builder to reuse it
	// In V, `clear()` clears the builder's buffer.
	sb.clear()
	sb.write_string('New content in builder.')
	println(sb.str())
}
```

### Os Operations

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/02_os_operations/basic/os_operations.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/02_os_operations/basic/os_operations.v)_

### Lesson: Os Operations

V's standard library provides a rich set of cross-platform functions for interacting with the operating system through the `os` module. Here is the simplest, most practical guide to when you should actually use each of these functions in real-world programming.

---

#### 1. Basic File Operations

- **The Vibe:** The "Standard file cabinets."
- **What it does:** Writes, reads, and checks the existence of files using simple string and byte helpers.
- **Best to use when:** You need to dump text, save config settings, or read small files quickly.
- **Real-world example:** Writing user session logs or reading a local settings file.

#### 2. Directory Tree Operations

- **The Vibe:** The "Digital folder builder."
- **What it does:** Creates nested folders (`mkdir_all`) or removes them (`rmdir_all`).
- **Best to use when:** You need to construct file paths for organized data storage.
- **Real-world example:** Creating a new user cache folder like `cache/images/temp/`.

#### 3. Path Manipulation & Extraction

- **The Vibe:** The "Path dissection tool."
- **What it does:** Extracts directory paths, base names, file extensions, and normalizes them.
- **Best to use when:** You have a file path and want to rename the file or get its extension without manual string parsing.
- **Real-world example:** Checking if an uploaded file has a `.jpg` extension.

#### 4. Environment & Command Execution

- **The Vibe:** "Talking to the host machine."
- **What it does:** Reads system environment variables and runs shell commands.
- **Best to use when:** You need to fetch config keys (like API tokens) or execute external utilities (like running `git version`).
- **Real-world example:** Fetching the `HOME` directory to locate user configuration files.

#### 5. File Permissions & Ownership (Chmod/Chown)

- **The Vibe:** The "Keymaster/security guard."
- **What it does:** Alters who can read/write/execute a file and changes user/group owner IDs.
- **Best to use when:** Making a script executable or securing sensitive credentials.
- **Real-world example:** Restricting a database file's permissions to be readable only by the owner (`chmod 0o600`).

#### 6. Globbing

- **The Vibe:** The "Wildcard detector."
- **What it does:** Matches a list of files using wildcard patterns (like `*.txt`).
- **Best to use when:** You need to process a batch of files matching a name template.
- **Real-world example:** Storing files matching `log_*.txt` and deleting them in a batch.

### Time And Stopwatch

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/03_time_and_stopwatch/time_and_stopwatch.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/03_time_and_stopwatch/time_and_stopwatch.v)_

### Lesson: Time And Stopwatch

V's standard library provides a robust and precise set of utilities for time retrieval, formatting, parsing, timezone management, and execution timing via the `time` module. Here is the simplest, most practical guide to when you should actually use each of these tools in real-world programming.

---

#### 1. Time Retrieval & Fields

- **The Vibe:** "Checking your wristwatch."
- **What it does:** Gets the exact current date, time, and nanoseconds.
- **Best to use when:** You need to timestamp actions or log events.
- **Real-world example:** Recording when a user logs in.

#### 2. Time Arithmetic & Comparisons

- **The Vibe:** "Time-traveling and deadlines."
- **What it does:** Adds or subtracts intervals (days, hours, seconds) and compares which time comes first.
- **Best to use when:** You need to calculate expirations or duration differences.
- **Real-world example:** Setting a user token to expire in 2 hours.

#### 3. String Formatting & RFC Standards

- **The Vibe:** "The translator for calendar dates."
- **What it does:** Converts raw timestamps into clean, human-readable formats, custom strings, or RFC 3339 standards.
- **Best to use when:** Displaying dates to users or sending structured time JSON over APIs.
- **Real-world example:** Printing a post publish date as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss`.

#### 4. Timezone Conversions (Local & UTC)

- **The Vibe:** "The jet-lag cure."
- **What it does:** Converts times between local system time and UTC.
- **Best to use when:** You store timestamps in UTC (best practice) but need to show them in the user's local timezone.
- **Real-world example:** Normalizing database entries to UTC time.

#### 5. Relative Time

- **The Vibe:** "Social media date labels."
- **What it does:** Formats dates relative to now (e.g., "5 minutes ago", "yesterday").
- **Best to use when:** Displaying activity feeds or notification boards.
- **Real-world example:** Showing how long ago a comment was posted.

#### 6. Stopwatch

- **The Vibe:** "The performance racing timer."
- **What it does:** Measures sub-millisecond elapsed durations.
- **Best to use when:** Benchmarking code speed or tracking long-running tasks.
- **Real-world example:** Measuring how long an API database query took to run.

### Datatypes Collections

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/07_datatypes_collections/datatypes_collections.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/07_datatypes_collections/datatypes_collections.v)_

### Lesson: Datatypes Collections

V's standard library provides a rich set of built-in collections and data structures through the `datatypes` module. Here is the simplest, most practical guide to when you should actually use each of these data structures in real-world programming.

---

#### 1. Bloom Filter

- **The Vibe:** The "Fast bouncer at the door."
- **What it does:** It tells you with 100% certainty if something is **not** there, but if it says something **is** there, it might be guessing (a false positive).
- **Best to use when:** You have a massive database and searching it takes too long. You use a Bloom Filter as a quick shield. If the filter says _"Nope, that username doesn't exist,"_ you don't waste time searching the database.
- **Real-world example:** Checking if a chosen username is taken, or filtering out malicious URLs before loading a website.

#### 2. Set

- **The Vibe:** The "No Duplicates Allowed" club.
- **What it does:** Stores a collection of items where everything **must be unique**. It also lets you do math operations like combining two groups (Union) or finding what they have in common (Intersection).
- **Best to use when:** You need to filter out duplicates instantly, or you need to compare two groups of data to find common ground.
- **Real-world example:** Storing unique visitor IP addresses on a website, or finding a list of mutual friends between you and someone else.

#### 3. Queue

- **The Vibe:** Waiting in line at a grocery store (First In, First Out / FIFO).
- **What it does:** The first item you put in is the first item you take out.
- **Best to use when:** You have tasks that need to be processed exactly in the order they arrived.
- **Real-world example:** A printer queue handling documents, or customer support tickets waiting to be answered by an agent.

#### 4. Stack

- **The Vibe:** A stack of dinner plates (Last In, First Out / LIFO).
- **What it does:** The last item you put on top is the first one you have to take off.
- **Best to use when:** You need to keep track of a history of actions so you can reverse them, or track active processes.
- **Real-world example:** The "Undo" ($Ctrl+Z$) feature in a text editor, or the "Back" button history in your web browser.

#### 5. Ring Buffer (Circular Buffer)

- **The Vibe:** A streaming video that continuously overwrites itself.
- **What it does:** A queue with a strict maximum size. When it gets full, new data wraps around to the beginning and overwrites the oldest data.
- **Best to use when:** You are handling a continuous stream of data and you only care about the most recent information, without wasting memory.
- **Real-world example:** Audio/video streaming playback buffers, or a flight data recorder ("black box") that only saves the last 24 hours of flight data.

#### 6. Min Heap

- **The Vibe:** A VIP line where the most urgent person always gets to go first.
- **What it does:** A specialized structure that always keeps the _smallest_ (or highest priority) value at the very top.
- **Best to use when:** You need to constantly pull the lowest/highest value out of a changing list without sorting the entire list every single time.
- **Real-world example:** A hospital emergency room triage system, or GPS apps calculating the shortest route dynamically.

#### 7. BSTree (Binary Search Tree)

- **The Vibe:** A perfectly organized filing cabinet.
- **What it does:** Keeps data sorted automatically as you add it. Smaller numbers go left, larger numbers go right.
- **Best to use when:** You need to search, add, and delete items constantly, and you always need the data to stay in perfect alphabetical or numerical order.
- **Real-world example:** File systems on your computer, or database indexing to make searching millions of records instant.

#### 8. LinkedList vs. DoublyLinkedList

- **The Vibe:** A scavenger hunt. Item A gives you a clue to find Item B, which gives you a clue to find Item C.
- **What it does:**
  - **LinkedList (Singly):** Each item points only to the _next_ item. You can only move forward.
  - **DoublyLinkedList:** Each item points to both the _next_ item and the _previous_ item. You can move forward and backward.
- **Best to use when:** You are constantly adding or removing items from the very beginning or middle of a list. (Standard arrays are slow at this because they have to shift all the other items over; Linked Lists just change where the "clues" point).
- **Real-world example:** A music playlist. A regular linked list only lets you hit "Next". A doubly linked list lets you hit "Next" and "Previous".

### Gg Graphics

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/08_gg_graphics/gg_graphics.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/08_gg_graphics/gg_graphics.v)_

### Lesson: Gg Graphics

V has a very rich and growing standard library and is actively updated. This lesson on **Gg Graphics** showcases modern standard library packages, system calls, network sockets, inline assembly, or WASM support.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **gg graphics** using V's simple graphics module. It shows how to initialize a window, define an application state struct, draw various 2D shapes (rectangles, circles, triangles, polygons, lines), render formatted text, and intercept keyboard and mouse event inputs.

```v
module main

import gg
import math

// AppContext holds the state of our graphical application.
// Using a state struct is a recommended best practice for gg applications
// to avoid global variables (which V does not support by default).
struct AppContext {
mut:
	ctx    &gg.Context = unsafe { nil }
	width  int         = 800
	height int         = 600
	// Interactive shape parameters
	shape_x      f32      = 400.0
	shape_y      f32      = 300.0
	shape_size   f32      = 50.0
	shape_color  gg.Color = gg.blue
	active_shape int // 0 = Circle, 1 = Rectangle, 2 = Triangle
	// Tracking mouse positions and clicks
	mouse_x     f32
	mouse_y     f32
	click_x     f32      = -1.0
	click_y     f32      = -1.0
	click_color gg.Color = gg.red
	// Last key pressed message
	last_key string = 'None'
}

fn main() {
	// Initialize state
	mut app := &AppContext{
		width:  800
		height: 600
	}

	// Create a new gg context.
	// You specify callbacks for rendering frames, processing events,
	// and cleanups, along with initial window configurations.

### Command Line Arguments

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/09_command_line_arguments/command_line_arguments.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/09_command_line_arguments/command_line_arguments.v)_

This example demonstrates how to directly access and parse command-line arguments using `os.args` to build simple command-line applications.

```v
module main

import os

fn main() {
	// os.args is a []string containing all command line arguments.
	// os.args[0] is always the name of the executable (or the script path if run via v run).
	// os.args[1..] contains the actual command-line arguments passed to the program.
	println('Executable / script path: ${os.args[0]}')
	println('Total arguments count:    ${os.args.len}')
	println('All arguments list:       ${os.args}')

	if os.args.len < 2 {
		println('\nUsage: v run command_line_arguments.v <command> [arguments...]')
		println('Try running: v run command_line_arguments.v greet Alice')
		println('Try running: v run command_line_arguments.v sum 3 5 8')
		return
	}

	command := os.args[1]
	args := os.args[2..]

	println('\nProcessing command: "${command}" with args: ${args}')

	match command {
		'greet' {
			if args.len < 1 {

### Math And Rand

### Lesson: Math And Rand

V's math and rand modules expose far more than the basic trigonometry and random-int helpers. The example below expands the repository walkthrough with additional documented functions from the current V docs, including exponentiation, clamping, logarithms, bytes, hex strings, ULIDs, and ranged integer generation.

### Sync Concurrency

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/12_sync_concurrency/sync_concurrency.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/12_sync_concurrency/sync_concurrency.v)_

### Lesson: Sync Concurrency

V supports lightweight concurrency using **v-routines** via the `spawn` keyword (which spawns a function in a new thread). Threads communicate safely using **channels**, which prevent race conditions. For shared memory concurrency, V provides the `shared` keyword alongside `lock` and `unlock` blocks to safely synchronize access to variables.

These examples cover spawning tasks, reading/writing channels, buffering, select statements, and thread synchronization.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **sync concurrency**.

```v
module main

import sync
import time

fn worker(id int, mut wg sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer {
		wg.done()
	}
	println('Worker ${id} starting...')
	time.sleep(50 * time.millisecond)
	println('Worker ${id} done!')
}

fn main() {
	println('=== Sync & Concurrency Examples ===')

	// 1. WaitGroup (Wait for multiple goroutines/tasks)
	mut wg := sync.new_waitgroup()
	for i in 1 .. 4 {
		wg.add(1)
		go worker(i, mut wg)
	}
	wg.wait()
	println('All workers completed!')

	// 2. Mutex (Thread-safe shared state access)
	println('\n=== Mutex Demo ===')
	mut mu := sync.new_mutex()
	mu.@lock()
	println('Mutex locked')
	mu.unlock()
	println('Mutex unlocked')
}

### Term

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/17_term/term.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/17_term/term.v)_

### Lesson: Term

V's standard library provides a direct, cross-platform module named `term` for querying terminal attributes, altering console text colors/styles, and printing preformatted output badges. Here is the simplest, most practical guide to when you should actually use each of these tools in real-world programming.

---

#### 1. Terminal Size Metadata

- **The Vibe:** "Measuring the room size."
- **What it does:** Tells you how many columns (width) and rows (height) are currently visible in the user's terminal window.
- **Best to use when:** You are rendering custom terminal layouts, tables, or ASCII art that must fit the screen.
- **Real-world example:** Wrapping text dynamically so it doesn't spill over the screen edge.

#### 2. ANSI Text Coloring

- **The Vibe:** "Adding paint to the console."
- **What it does:** Applies green, red, yellow, or blue styling to terminal characters.
- **Best to use when:** Highlighting success, errors, warnings, or structural tags.
- **Real-world example:** Printing error messages in bold red.

#### 3. Styling Modifiers

- **The Vibe:** "The font options panel."
- **What it does:** Renders text as bold, underlined, or strikethrough.
- **Best to use when:** Emphasizing headings, showing links, or marking deprecated options.
- **Real-world example:** Printing column headers of a CLI table in bold.

#### 4. Background Fills & Combinations

- **The Vibe:** "The highlighter pen."
- **What it does:** Fills the text background block with color, and supports mixing foreground styles and background styles.
- **Best to use when:** Creating alerts, status blocks, or highlighting active menu items.
- **Real-world example:** Printing a yellow warning status badge with a blue background.

#### 5. Preformatted Messages

- **The Vibe:** "The instant status stamp."
- **What it does:** Provides preformatted `[OK]`, `[WARNING]`, and `[FAILED]` status boxes with colors built in.
- **Best to use when:** Logging task progress or system bootstrap outputs.
- **Real-world example:** Printing `[OK] Server started on port 8080`.

---

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **term**.

```v
module main

import term

fn main() {
	println('=== term Module Demo ===')

	// ==========================================
	// 1. Terminal Size Metadata
	// ==========================================

	// term.get_terminal_size() returns the (width, height) of the active terminal session in columns and rows.
	width, height := term.get_terminal_size()
	println('Terminal size: ${width} columns x ${height} rows')

	// ==========================================
	// 2. Colored Text (Foreground Styling)
	// ==========================================

	// Foreground color helpers wrap the string with ANSI escape codes to change the text color.
	println(term.green('This text is green!'))
	println(term.red('This text is red!'))
	println(term.yellow('This text is yellow!'))
	println(term.blue('This text is blue!'))

	// ==========================================
	// 3. Text Styles & Modifiers
	// ==========================================

	// Text modifiers add visual decorations like bold, underline, or strikethrough.
	println(term.bold('This text is bold!'))
	println(term.underline('This text is underlined!'))
	println(term.strikethrough('This text has a strikethrough!'))

	// ==========================================
	// 4. Background Styling
	// ==========================================

	// Background color helpers fill the background area behind the printed characters.
	println(term.bg_blue(' This has a blue background! '))

	// ==========================================
	// 5. Mixed Styling & Layering
	// ==========================================

	// We can combine text color, style (bold/underline), and background color by nesting the calls.
	println(term.bg_blue(term.yellow(' Yellow text on a blue background ')))
	println(term.bg_red(term.white(term.bold(' Bold white text on a red background '))))
	println(term.bg_green(term.black(term.underline(' Underlined black text on a green background '))))

	// ==========================================
	// 6. Preformatted Status Messages
	// ==========================================

	// V's term module provides built-in preformatted status message helper templates.
	// These automatically print colored status stamps like [OK], [WARNING], or [FAILED] followed by the message.
	println(term.ok_message('Operation succeeded!'))
	println(term.warn_message('This is a warning!'))
	println(term.fail_message('Operation failed!'))
}
```

import benchmark
import time

fn main() {
	println('=== benchmark Module Demo ===')

	// Example 1: Using benchmark.start() and measure()
	println('--- Simple Measurement ---')
	mut b := benchmark.start()

	// Simulate work chunk 1
	time.sleep(50 * time.millisecond)
	b.measure('Simulated task 1 (50ms sleep)')

	// Simulate work chunk 2
	time.sleep(100 * time.millisecond)
	b.measure('Simulated task 2 (100ms sleep)')

	// Example 2: Using structured new_benchmark()
	println('\n--- Structured Step-by-Step Benchmarking ---')
	mut bmark := benchmark.new_benchmark()

	// Step 1: Ok step
	bmark.step()
	time.sleep(30 * time.millisecond)
	bmark.ok()
	println(bmark.step_message('Step 1 (successful arithmetic)'))

	// Step 2: Failed step demo
	bmark.step()
	time.sleep(10 * time.millisecond)
	bmark.fail()
	println(bmark.step_message('Step 2 (simulated failure verification)'))

	// Finalize and print results summary
	bmark.stop()
	println(bmark.total_message('Final summary of execution stages'))
}
```

	mut cb := clipboard.new()
	defer {
		cb.destroy()
	}

	if !cb.is_available() {
		println('Clipboard is not available on this platform/session.')
		return
	}

	// 2. Backup current clipboard content so we do not overwrite user data permanently
	original_text := cb.paste()
	println('Backed up original clipboard text (length: ${original_text.len})')

	// 3. Copy new text to clipboard
	test_message := 'Hello from Vlang standard library!'
	println('Copying text to clipboard: "${test_message}"')
	if cb.copy(test_message) {
		println('Text successfully copied!')
	} else {
		println('Failed to copy text.')

## Strings.Lorem Helper

### Strings Lorem

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/36_strings_lorem/strings_lorem.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/36_strings_lorem/strings_lorem.v)_

V's standard library `strings.lorem` module provides a pseudo-random text generator based on a Markov chain built from embedded corpora. It produces structured text in the form of paragraphs and sentences, with options to control layouts, select specific corpora, and configure deterministic output.

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Generate pseudo-random text with default configurations.
2. Customize the output layout by adjusting words per sentence, sentences per paragraph, and paragraphs.
3. Select specific corpora such as `lorem` (Latin), `poe` (Edgar Allan Poe), `darwin` (Charles Darwin), and `bard` (William Shakespeare).
4. Run deterministic generation using an RNG seed and a custom starting phrase.

---

```v
module main

import strings.lorem

fn main() {
	println('=== V strings.lorem Standard Library Demo ===')

	// 1. Basic Generation with Default Configuration
	// By default, it will choose a random corpus, seed phrase, and RNG seed.
	println('\n--- 1. Default Lorem Ipsum Generation ---')
	default_lorem := lorem.generate(lorem.LoremCfg{})
	println(default_lorem)

	// 2. Custom Layout Configuration (Paragraphs, Sentences, Words)
	println('\n--- 2. Custom Layout Generation ---')
	custom_layout := lorem.generate(lorem.LoremCfg{
		paragraphs:              2
		sentences_per_paragraph: 3
		words_per_sentence:      6
	})
	println(custom_layout)

	// 3. Selection of Specific Embedded Corpora
	// V's strings.lorem module supports four built-in corpora:
	// - 'lorem' (Standard Latin Lorem Ipsum)
	// - 'poe' (Edgar Allan Poe's The Raven)
	// - 'darwin' (Charles Darwin's Origin of Species)
	// - 'bard' (William Shakespeare's works)
	println('\n--- 3. Specific Corpora Examples ---')

	corpora := ['lorem', 'poe', 'darwin', 'bard']
	for corpus in corpora {
		text := lorem.generate(lorem.LoremCfg{
			corpus_name:             corpus
			paragraphs:              1
			sentences_per_paragraph: 2
			words_per_sentence:      8
		})
		println('Corpus [${corpus}]:')
		println(text)
		println('-'.repeat(40))
	}

	// 4. Deterministic Text Generation using RNG Seed and Custom Seed Phrases
	// Using a specific `rng_seed` guarantees that the generated pseudo-random text is deterministic
	// and identical across multiple runs. Custom `seed_text` provides a starting phrase for the Markov chain.
	println('\n--- 4. Deterministic Generation with Seed & Custom Starting Phrase ---')
	deterministic_lorem_1 := lorem.generate(lorem.LoremCfg{
		corpus_name:             'poe'
		rng_seed:                42
		seed_text:               'once upon a midnight'
		paragraphs:              1
		sentences_per_paragraph: 2
		words_per_sentence:      8
	})

	deterministic_lorem_2 := lorem.generate(lorem.LoremCfg{
		corpus_name:             'poe'
		rng_seed:                42
		seed_text:               'once upon a midnight'
		paragraphs:              1
		sentences_per_paragraph: 2
		words_per_sentence:      8
	})

	println('Run 1:')
	println(deterministic_lorem_1)
	println('\nRun 2:')
	println(deterministic_lorem_2)

	// Assert that they are exactly identical due to deterministic seeding
	assert deterministic_lorem_1 == deterministic_lorem_2
	println('\nDeterministic assertion passed! Both runs generated identical text.')
}
```

## WebAssembly Compilation

V has first-class support for WebAssembly (WASM). There are two distinct methods for compiling and working with WebAssembly in V:

1. **Compiling V source code to WASM** (using direct/native backends or Emscripten).
2. **Programmatic WASM generation** (using the built-in `wasm` instruction-level builder).

---

### Compiling V Source to WebAssembly

#### 1. Native Direct Backend (`-b wasm`)

V contains a native compiler backend that bypasses C intermediate code and outputs WebAssembly binary files (`.wasm`) directly. This backend has zero dependencies and is extremely fast, though it is currently in active development and supports a subset of the language.

To compile a V file directly to WASM:

```bash
v -b wasm -o main.wasm main.v
```

##### Executing in JavaScript/Node.js:

To run the natively compiled WASM binary, instantiate it using the standard JavaScript `WebAssembly` API:

```javascript
const fs = require("fs");

async function run() {
  const wasmBuffer = fs.readFileSync("main.wasm");
  const { instance } = await WebAssembly.instantiate(wasmBuffer, {
    env: {
      // Import host functions here if needed
    },
  });
  // Call exported V functions from JS
  console.log(instance.exports.add(5, 10));
}
run();
```

#### 2. Emscripten C Backend (`-os wasm`)

For compiling complex applications, standard library features, or C-linked dependencies to WASM, V relies on the Emscripten toolchain. V translates the V code to intermediate C, and Emscripten compiles it to highly optimized WebAssembly.

##### Prerequisites:

Ensure the Emscripten SDK (`emsdk`) is installed and active on your PATH:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latest
source ./emsdk_env.sh
```

##### Compiling with V:

```bash
v -os wasm -o main.js main.v
```

This produces:

- `main.wasm`: The compiled WebAssembly binary.
- `main.js`: Emscripten glue code to load the WASM module and map runtime environments (I/O, memory, filesystem).

##### Running in Node.js:

```bash
node main.js
```

---

### Programmatic WASM Generation

#### Programmatic WASM Builder

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/35_wasm/wasm.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/02_standard_library/35_wasm/wasm.v)_

V provides a built-in `wasm` module in its standard library that allows developers to programmatically build WebAssembly binary (`.wasm`) files directly using instruction-level builder patterns. This is extremely useful for compilers, runtime engines, or dynamic code generation targeting the browser and other WebAssembly runtimes.

This example demonstrates how to:

1. Initialize a WebAssembly module (`wasm.Module`).
2. Generate exported arithmetic functions (`add`, `sub`, `mul`).
3. Construct and read mutable global variables (`new_global`, `global_get`, `global_set`).
4. Build recursive control structures (a factorial `fac` function utilizing `c_if`, `c_else`, `c_end`, and recursive `call`).
5. Compile the module down to a `.wasm` binary slice (`[]u8`) and save it to disk.

```v
module main

import wasm
import os

fn main() {
	println('=== V WebAssembly (wasm) Module Demo ===')

	// Initialize the WebAssembly module
	mut m := wasm.Module{}
	m.enable_debug('vlang_wasm_demo')

	// --- 1. Basic Arithmetic Functions ---
	println('\n1. Generating Arithmetic Functions (add, sub, mul)...')

	// Exported 'add' function: taking two i32 parameters, returning one i32 result
	mut add_fn := m.new_function('add', [.i32_t, .i32_t], [.i32_t])
	{
		add_fn.local_get(0)
		add_fn.local_get(1)
		add_fn.add(.i32_t)
	}
	m.commit(add_fn, true) // commit with export = true

	// Exported 'sub' function
	mut sub_fn := m.new_function('sub', [.i32_t, .i32_t], [.i32_t])
	{
		sub_fn.local_get(0)
		sub_fn.local_get(1)
		sub_fn.sub(.i32_t)
	}
	m.commit(sub_fn, true)

	// Exported 'mul' function
	mut mul_fn := m.new_function('mul', [.i32_t, .i32_t], [.i32_t])
	{
		mul_fn.local_get(0)
		mul_fn.local_get(1)
		mul_fn.mul(.i32_t)
	}
	m.commit(mul_fn, true)

	// --- 2. Global Variables ---
	println('\n2. Creating Global Variables...')
	// Global variable named '__vsp' (Stack Pointer), internal/non-exported, type i32, mutable, init value 10
	vsp := m.new_global('__vsp', false, .i32_t, true, wasm.constexpr_value(10))

	// Create a function that retrieves the global value, adds 20, stores it back, and returns the new value
	mut vsp_fn := m.new_function('update_vsp', [], [.i32_t])
	{
		vsp_fn.global_get(vsp)
		vsp_fn.i32_const(20)
		vsp_fn.add(.i32_t)
		vsp_fn.global_set(vsp)
		vsp_fn.global_get(vsp)
	}
	m.commit(vsp_fn, true)

	// --- 3. Recursive Functions (Factorial) ---
	println('\n3. Generating Recursive Function (fac)...')
	// fac(n) returns n! using i64 types
	mut fac_fn := m.new_function('fac', [.i64_t], [.i64_t])
	{
		fac_fn.local_get(0)
		fac_fn.eqz(.i64_t)

		// If block: if n == 0, return 1
		ifs := fac_fn.c_if([], [.i64_t])
		{
			fac_fn.i64_const(1)
		}
		fac_fn.c_else(ifs)
		{
			// Else: return n * fac(n - 1)
			fac_fn.local_get(0) // push n

			fac_fn.local_get(0)
			fac_fn.i64_const(1)
			fac_fn.sub(.i64_t) // n - 1
			fac_fn.call('fac') // recursive call to fac(n - 1)

			fac_fn.mul(.i64_t) // n * fac(n - 1)
		}
		fac_fn.c_end(ifs)
	}
	m.commit(fac_fn, true)

	// --- 4. Compilation & Output ---
	println('\n4. Compiling Module to WebAssembly Binary...')
	binary_code := m.compile()
	println('Compilation Successful! Binary size: ${binary_code.len} bytes')

	// Save compiled binary as output.wasm in the current directory
	dir := os.dir(@FILE)
	output_path := os.join_path(dir, 'output.wasm')
	os.write_file(output_path, binary_code.bytestr()) or {
		println('Failed to write output.wasm: ${err}')
		return
	}
	println('Saved Wasm binary to: ${output_path}')
}
```

### sizeof and \_\_offsetof

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/09_sizeof_and_offsetof/sizeof_and_offsetof.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/09_sizeof_and_offsetof/sizeof_and_offsetof.v)_

### Lesson: sizeof and \_\_offsetof

V provides two built-in operators for determining sizes and memory offsets:

- `sizeof(Type)`: Returns the memory size of the given Type in bytes.
- `__offsetof(Struct, field_name)`: Returns the offset in bytes of a field relative to the start of the struct.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Size of `Point`**:
  `sizeof(Point)` yields `8` bytes because it has two `int` fields (4 bytes each).
- **Size of `Foo` & Alignment Padding**:
  `sizeof(Foo)` yields `12` bytes, even though it contains `a int` (4 bytes), `b u8` (1 byte), and `c int` (4 bytes). This happens because of C ABI alignment: V aligns struct members on word boundaries (in this case, 4 bytes), adding 3 bytes of invisible padding after `b u8`.
- **Offsets of fields in `Foo`**:
  - `__offsetof(Foo, a)` yields `0` because it starts at byte 0.
  - `__offsetof(Foo, b)` yields `4` because it starts right after `a` (4 bytes).
  - `__offsetof(Foo, c)` yields `8` because it aligns on the next 4-byte boundary due to padding after `b`.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **sizeof and \_\_offsetof**.

```v
module main

struct Point {
	x int
	y int
}

struct Foo {
	a int
	b u8
	c int
}

fn main() {
	// sizeof gives the size of a type in bytes
	println('sizeof(Point) = ${sizeof(Point)} bytes') // 8
	println('sizeof(Foo) = ${sizeof(Foo)} bytes') // 12 (due to alignment/padding in C backend)

	// __offsetof gives the offset in bytes of a struct field
	println('__offsetof(Point, x) = ${__offsetof(Point, x)}') // 0
	println('__offsetof(Point, y) = ${__offsetof(Point, y)}') // 4
	println('__offsetof(Foo, a) = ${__offsetof(Foo, a)}') // 0
	println('__offsetof(Foo, b) = ${__offsetof(Foo, b)}') // 4
	println('__offsetof(Foo, c) = ${__offsetof(Foo, c)}') // 8
}
```

### Limited Operator Overloading

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/10_operator_overloading/operator_overloading.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/10_operator_overloading/operator_overloading.v)_

### Lesson: Limited Operator Overloading

Operator overloading is supported for a limited set of binary operators (`+, -, *, **, /, %, <, ==`) to improve readability in scientific, mathematical, and graphics applications. V does not support indexing (`[]`) or assignment (`=`) overloading. Overloading the `+` operator automatically synthesizes the matching assignment operator (e.g., `+=`).

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Binary Operator Overloading**:
  We define the `+` and `-` operators for struct `Vec` using the syntax `fn (a Vec) + (b Vec) Vec`. V invokes these methods directly when performing arithmetic expressions like `a + b` or `a - b`.
- **Equality Operator Overloading**:
  We define `==` to verify element-by-element equality: `a.x == b.x && a.y == b.y`.
- **Automatic Assignment Generation**:
  When we overload `+`, V autogenerates the compound assignment operator `+=`. Executing `c += a` resolves to `c = c + a`, compiling and modifying `c` automatically.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **limited operator overloading**.

```v
module main

struct Vec {
	x int
	y int
}

fn (a Vec) str() string {
	return '{${a.x}, ${a.y}}'
}

// Overload addition operator (+)
fn (a Vec) + (b Vec) Vec {
	return Vec{a.x + b.x, a.y + b.y}
}

// Overload subtraction operator (-)
fn (a Vec) - (b Vec) Vec {
	return Vec{a.x - b.x, a.y - b.y}
}

// Overload equality operator (==)
fn (a Vec) == (b Vec) bool {
	return a.x == b.x && a.y == b.y
}

fn main() {
	a := Vec{2, 3}
	b := Vec{4, 5}
	mut c := Vec{1, 2}

	println('a + b = ${a + b}') // {6, 8}
	println('a - b = ${a - b}') // {-2, -2}

	// c += a is autogenerated from the + overload!
	c += a
	println('c after += a: ${c}') // {3, 5}

	println('a == b: ${a == b}') // false
	println('a == Vec{2, 3}: ${a == Vec{2, 3}}') // true
}
```

### Atomics

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/11_atomics/atomics.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/11_atomics/atomics.v)_

### Lesson: Atomics

V does not have direct keyword support for atomic operations but integrates standard C11 atomic capabilities through platform-specific wrapper headers (found under `stdatomic/`). Variables can be treated atomically by executing type-specific functions prefixed by `C.atomic_` and passing references to the target variables.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **C Header Inclusion**:
  Depending on the compilation target, V includes either the Unix or Windows wrapper headers `atomic.h` containing atomic operations.
- **C declarations**:
  `fn C.atomic_store_u32(&u32, u32)` and other methods are declared. Since V does not automatically parse C headers, we manually declare the C functions we want to invoke.
- **Local Storage**:
  We declare a local variable `atom := u32(0)` inside `main()`. Any variable can be treated atomically by passing its memory reference (pointer) to the C functions. This avoids needing global variables or compiling with `-enable-globals` flag.
- **CAS (Compare-And-Swap)**:
  Inside `unsafe { ... }`, we call `C.atomic_compare_exchange_strong_u32(&atom, &expected, 23)`. If the value at `&atom` matches `expected` (17), it replaces it with `23` and returns `true`. If not, it loads the actual current value into `expected` and returns `false`.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **atomics**.

```v
module main

$if windows {
	#include "@VEXEROOT/thirdparty/stdatomic/win/atomic.h"
} $else {
	#include "@VEXEROOT/thirdparty/stdatomic/nix/atomic.h"
}

// declare the C functions we want to use
fn C.atomic_store_u32(&u32, u32)
fn C.atomic_load_u32(&u32) u32
fn C.atomic_compare_exchange_strong_u32(&u32, &u32, u32) bool

fn main() {
	// Ordinary local variable, treated as atomic by passing its reference
	mut atom := u32(0)

	// Initialize atomic variable
	unsafe {
		C.atomic_store_u32(&atom, 17)

		mut expected := u32(17)
		// Atomic CAS: if atom == expected, set atom to 23 and return true
		if C.atomic_compare_exchange_strong_u32(&atom, &expected, 23) {
			println('Exchange successful, atom is now 23')
		} else {
			println('Exchange failed, atom is ${C.atomic_load_u32(&atom)}')
		}

		println('Final value: ${C.atomic_load_u32(&atom)}')
	}
}
```

### Static Variables

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/12_static_variables/static_variables.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/12_static_variables/static_variables.v)_

### Lesson: Static Variables

V supports **Static Variables** within functions. They behave like namespaced global variables, preserving state across function calls, but are restricted to the local scope of a single function. Functions containing static variables must be marked with `@[unsafe]` and calls must occur in `unsafe` blocks. They are primarily intended for facilitating low-level C code translations.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Static Variable Definition**:
  Inside the function `counter()`, we define `mut static x := 42`. The compiler generates this variable in the global data space but restricts access to it exclusively within `counter()`.
- **One-Time Initialization**:
  The initialization expression `= 42` is executed exactly once when the program starts. It is skipped on subsequent calls to `counter()`.
- **Access Rules**:
  Because static variables represent shared mutable state, `counter()` is marked with `@[unsafe]` and called within `unsafe` blocks in `main()`.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **static variables**.

```v
module main

// V supports function-scoped static variables inside unsafe functions
@[unsafe]
fn counter() int {
	// static variables are initialized only once
	mut static x := 42
	x++
	return x
}

fn main() {
	println(unsafe { counter() }) // 43
	println(unsafe { counter() }) // 44
	println(unsafe { counter() }) // 45
}
```

### Hot Code Reloading

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/13_hot_code_reloading/hot_code_reloading.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/13_hot_code_reloading/hot_code_reloading.v)_

### Lesson: Hot Code Reloading

V supports **Hot Code Reloading** using the `@[live]` attribute. By compiling a program with the `-live` flag (e.g. `v -live run file.v`), V monitors the source files, automatically recompiles live-annotated functions to a shared library, and reloads them dynamically at runtime without restarting the application.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Live Annotation**:
  The function `print_message()` is marked with the `@[live]` attribute. This instructs the compiler to generate it as a hot-reloadable hook loading from a shared library.
- **Main loop execution**:
  The loop in `main()` runs continuously. If you modify the message in the string print inside `print_message()` and save the file, V's monitoring thread detects the change, rebuilds the code, and subsequent calls in the loop print the updated message instantly.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **hot code reloading**.

```v
module main

import time

// Functions that should be reloaded must have `@[live]` attribute
@[live]
fn print_message() {
	println('Hello! Modify this message while the program is running under -live mode.')
}

fn main() {
	// A simple loop printing the message
	for i in 0 .. 3 {
		print_message()
		time.sleep(100 * time.millisecond)
	}
}
```

### Compile-Time Reflection

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/14_compile_time_reflection/compile_time_reflection.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/14_compile_time_reflection/compile_time_reflection.v)_

### Lesson: Compile-Time Reflection

V supports **Compile-Time Reflection** using the `$` prefix to perform type operations, evaluations, and code generation during compilation. V iterates over struct fields, attributes, variants, and methods at compile-time using `$for` loops, providing static safety without any runtime metadata overhead.

- Struct fields can be examined via `Struct.fields`.
- Struct attributes can be examined via `Struct.attributes`.
- Struct methods can be examined via `Struct.methods`, and executed dynamically using `$method()`.

#### Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough:

- **Field Iteration (`$for field in User.fields`)**:
  Iterates over all fields of `User`. Evaluates their names (`field.name`) and type IDs (`field.typ`) at compile-time.
- **Attribute Iteration (`$for attr in User.attributes`)**:
  Inspects attributes attached to the struct, such as `@[COLOR]` (prints `COLOR`).
- **Comptime Method Invocation (`user.$method()`)**:
  Inside `$for m in User.methods`, we check if the method returns a `string`. If so, we execute the method dynamically using the `$method()` comptime syntax, calling `greet()` on the `user` instance and printing `Hello Alice`.

**Additional Context from Repository docs:**
This example demonstrates the concepts of **compile-time reflection**.

```v
module main

@[COLOR]
struct User {
	name string
	age  int
}

fn (u User) greet() string {
	return 'Hello ${u.name}'
}

fn main() {
	println('--- Struct Fields Reflection ---')
	$for field in User.fields {
		println('Field: ${field.name} | Typ: ${field.typ}')
	}
	println('\n--- Struct Attributes Reflection ---')
	$for attr in User.attributes {
		println('Attribute name: ${attr.name}')
	}
	println('\n--- Struct Methods Reflection ---')
	user := User{
		name: 'Alice'
		age:  30
	}
	$for m in User.methods {
		$if m.return_type is string {
			println(user.$method())
		}
	}
}
```

### Lesson: Compile-Time Pseudo Variables

V provides a set of pseudo-variables starting with `@` that are evaluated and substituted at compile time:

- **Scope Identifiers**:
  - `@FN` -> Replaced with the name of the current V function (as a string).
  - `@METHOD` -> Replaced with the `ReceiverType.MethodName` of the current method (as a string).
  - `@MOD` -> Replaced with the name of the current V module (as a string).
  - `@STRUCT` -> Replaced with the name of the current V struct (as a string).

### Environment-Specific Files & Compile-Time Types

### Lesson: Environment-Specific Files & Compile-Time Types

#### Environment-Specific Files

V supports compile-time filtering of entire files using file suffix conventions instead of conditional directives:

- `.js.v` -> compiled only when targeting the Javascript backend.
- `.c.v` -> compiled only when targeting the C backend.
- `_nix.c.v` -> compiled only on Unix-like platforms.
- `_windows.c.v` -> compiled only on Windows.
- `_d_customflag.v` -> compiled only if `-d customflag` is passed to the compiler.

#### Compile-Time Types

When writing generic code, V provides specialized compile-time type matching identifiers to selectively check generic constraints:

- `$alias` -> matches type aliases.
- `$array` -> matches arrays and fixed-size arrays.
- `$enum` -> matches enum types.
- `$float` / `$int` / `$string` -> matches floating numbers, integers, or string values.
- `$struct` -> matches struct types.

### References & Pointers

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/16_references/references.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/16_references/references.v)_

### Lesson: References & Pointers

In V, references are similar to pointers in Go/C and references in C++. They allow you to point to a memory location of another variable without making a copy of its contents.

#### 1. Passing by Value vs. Passing by Reference

When passing immutable arguments (like structs) to functions or methods, V decides under the hood whether to pass them by value or by reference depending on performance characteristics. As a developer, you do not need to worry about this optimization detail.

However, you can explicitly force an argument or method receiver to be passed by reference by prefixing the type with `&` (e.g., `&Foo`).

#### 2. Mutability of References

References in V are immutable by default:

- Even if a function or method receives a reference (`&Foo`), it cannot modify the fields of that struct unless the parameter is marked as mutable.
- To allow modification, the argument must be declared as `mut foo Foo` (which V automatically passes by reference under the hood) and called with `mut` (e.g. `modify_foo(mut my_foo)`). Note that modifiable fields must also be defined under the `mut:` access block in the struct declaration.

#### 3. Dereferencing

To access the underlying value of a reference directly, or to create a copy of the pointed-to object, use the dereferencing operator `*` (e.g., `copied_foo := *ref_to_foo`), similar to Go and C.

#### 4. Recursive Structures

Recursive data structures (such as linked lists or trees) require fields that reference their own type. Because V needs to calculate the memory size of structs at compile time, recursive fields must be declared as references (e.g., `left ?&Node[T]`) because references have a fixed pointer size.

- To allow optional/empty references (like leaf node terminations in trees), V supports **optional references** (e.g. `?&Node[T]`). These are automatically initialized to `none` by default, avoiding the need for `unsafe { nil }` pointers or dummy nodes.

---

Here is the complete demonstration program showcasing V references and recursive struct designs:

```v
module main

struct Foo {
mut:
	abc int
}

// 1. A method receiving a reference. The receiver type is &Foo.
// Even though it is a reference, `foo` is immutable and cannot be changed here.
fn (foo &Foo) print_abc() {
	println('print_abc: foo.abc = ${foo.abc}')
}

// 2. A regular function receiving a reference to Foo.
fn show_foo(foo &Foo) {
	println('show_foo: foo.abc = ${foo.abc}')
}

// 3. To modify a reference, we must pass it as mutable.
// Note that mutable parameters are passed by reference under the hood.
fn modify_foo(mut foo Foo, new_val int) {
	foo.abc = new_val
}

// 4. References are crucial for recursive types (like trees or linked lists).
// Since the size of Node must be known at compile time, recursive fields must be references.
// To allow optional/empty references (like leaf node terminations), V uses optional references (?&Node[T]).
struct Node[T] {
	val   T
	left  ?&Node[T]
	right ?&Node[T]
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V References & Pointers Demo ===')

	// Creating a struct instance
	mut my_foo := Foo{
		abc: 100
	}

	// Calling method on reference. V automatically takes the address of my_foo.
	my_foo.print_abc()

	// Calling a function expecting a reference using & operator.
	show_foo(&my_foo)

	// Modifying the struct via a mutable receiver/argument.
	modify_foo(mut my_foo, 200)
	println('After modify_foo: my_foo.abc = ${my_foo.abc}')

	// 5. Dereferencing a reference using the `*` operator.
	ref_to_foo := &my_foo
	// To copy the value of the struct pointed to by ref_to_foo:
	copied_foo := *ref_to_foo
	println('Copied foo abc: ${copied_foo.abc}')

	// 6. Generic Tree structure using optional references
	// Optional references are auto-initialized to `none`, so we don't need dummy nodes or `unsafe` blocks.
	left_leaf := Node[int]{
		val: 5
	}

	right_leaf := Node[int]{
		val: 15
	}

	// Create root node pointing to leaf references
	root := Node[int]{
		val:   10
		left:  &left_leaf
		right: &right_leaf
	}

	println('Root val: ${root.val}')

	// Access the optional child nodes safely using if guards
	if left := root.left {
		println('Left leaf val: ${left.val}')
	}
	if right := root.right {
		println('Right leaf val: ${right.val}')
	}
}
```

### Dumping Expressions at Runtime

_File location: [language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/17_dumping_expressions/dumping_expressions.v](language_updates_and_stdlib/01_language_basics_updates/17_dumping_expressions/dumping_expressions.v)_

### Lesson: Dumping Expressions at Runtime

You can dump/trace the value of any V expression using `dump(expr)`. For example, save this code sample as `factorial.v`, then run it with `v run factorial.v`:

```v
module main

fn factorial(n u32) u32 {
	if dump(n <= 1) {
		return dump(1)
	}
	return dump(n * factorial(n - 1))
}

fn main() {
	println(factorial(5))
}
```

You will get:

```
[factorial.v:4] n <= 1: false
[factorial.v:4] n <= 1: false
[factorial.v:4] n <= 1: false
[factorial.v:4] n <= 1: false
[factorial.v:4] n <= 1: true
[factorial.v:5] 1: 1
[factorial.v:7] n * factorial(n - 1): 2
[factorial.v:7] n * factorial(n - 1): 6
[factorial.v:7] n * factorial(n - 1): 24
[factorial.v:7] n * factorial(n - 1): 120
120
```

## Boilerplate Templates

### CLI Command-Line Application Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/01_cli_app/cli_app.v](boilerplate_templates/01_cli_app/cli_app.v)_

### Lesson: CLI Command-Line Application Boilerplate

When building command-line utilities, V provides a highly featured standard `flag` module. Rather than manually parsing arguments from `os.args`, the `flag` module simplifies declaring options, validation, and auto-generates helpful usage/help text.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Initializing flag parser**: Creating a new parser with `flag.new_flag_parser(os.args)`.
- **Defining Flags**: Specifying flag names, short character abbreviations, default values, and description text.
- **Config Struct Pattern**: Cleanly separating parsed options from application logic using a custom config struct.
- **Error Handling & Finalization**: Handling invalid command usage gracefully using `fp.finalize()`.

```v
module main

import flag
import os

// Config holds the validated configuration settings for the application.
struct Config {
	input_file  string
	output_file string
	verbose     bool
	retries     int
	mode        string
}

fn main() {
	// 1. Initialize the flag parser with command-line arguments (os.args)
	mut fp := flag.new_flag_parser(os.args)
	fp.application('v-cli-boilerplate')
	fp.version('1.0.0')
	fp.description('A professional CLI boilerplate showing flag parsing, validation, and structured configurations in V.')

	// 2. Skip the executable path during parsing
	fp.skip_executable()

	// 3. Define flags with short abbreviations, default values, and descriptions
	input_file := fp.string('input', `i`, '', 'Path to the input file (required)')
	output_file := fp.string('output', `o`, 'output.txt', 'Path to the output file')
	verbose := fp.bool('verbose', `v`, false, 'Enable verbose logging')
	retries := fp.int('retries', `r`, 3, 'Number of retries for operation')
	mode := fp.string('mode', `m`, 'default', 'Operation mode (default, fast, safe)')

	// 4. Finalize parsing. This returns remaining non-flag arguments or an error.
	additional_args := fp.finalize() or {
		eprintln('Error: ${err}')
		println(fp.usage())
		exit(1)
	}

	// 5. Validate required flags and values
	if input_file == '' {
		eprintln('Error: --input (-i) flag is required.')
		println(fp.usage())
		exit(1)
	}

	// Validate allowed values for a string enum
	if mode !in ['default', 'fast', 'safe'] {
		eprintln('Error: Invalid mode "${mode}". Must be one of: default, fast, safe.')
		println(fp.usage())
		exit(1)
	}

	// 6. Map parsed arguments to the Config struct for clean division of concerns
	config := Config{
		input_file:  input_file
		output_file: output_file
		verbose:     verbose
		retries:     retries
		mode:        mode
	}

	// 7. Run the application logic
	run_app(config, additional_args)
}

fn run_app(cfg Config, args []string) {
	if cfg.verbose {
		println('[DEBUG] Starting application execution...')
		println('[DEBUG] Config: ${cfg}')
		if args.len > 0 {
			println('[DEBUG] Positional Arguments: ${args}')
		}
	}

	println('Processing input file: ${cfg.input_file}')
	println('Operation mode: ${cfg.mode}')
	println('Retries configured: ${cfg.retries}')

	// Perform work here...
	println('Writing results to output file: ${cfg.output_file}')

	println('Success: Application executed successfully!')
}
```

### REST API Server Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/02_rest_api/rest_api.v](boilerplate_templates/02_rest_api/rest_api.v)_

### Lesson: REST API Server Boilerplate

V's standard web framework, `veb`, is optimized for building fast, high-conformance web apps and APIs. This template serves as a quick-start scaffolding for a JSON REST service, illustrating CRUD routing and request decoding.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Routing Attributes**: Tagging methods with route paths and HTTP verbs (e.g. `@['/api/items'; get]`).
- **Path Parameters**: Defining routes with dynamic segments like `@['/api/items/:id'; get]` which map directly to method arguments.
- **JSON Serialization/Deserialization**: Using `json.encode` and `json.decode` to work with HTTP requests and responses.
- **State Management & Thread Safety**: Using fields in the global `App` struct to share resources, protected by a `sync.RwMutex` to ensure thread-safe concurrent access.

```v
module main

import json
import os
import sync
import veb

// Item represents a data model in our API.
struct Item {
	id   int    @[json: 'id']
	name string @[json: 'name']
	done bool   @[json: 'done']
}

// App holds the global state of the application.
struct App {
mut:
	lock  sync.RwMutex
	items []Item
}

// Context wraps veb's request/response lifecycle.
struct Context {
	veb.Context
}

// 1. GET / - Simple text response index endpoint
fn (mut app App) index(mut ctx Context) veb.Result {
	return ctx.text('Welcome to the V REST API Boilerplate! Use /api/items to interact with the service.')
}

// 2. GET /api/items - Returns list of all items as JSON
@['/api/items'; get]
fn (mut app App) get_items(mut ctx Context) veb.Result {
	app.lock.@rlock()
	defer { app.lock.runlock() }
	return ctx.json(json.encode(app.items))
}

// 3. GET /api/items/:id - Returns a single item by id, or 404
@['/api/items/:id'; get]
fn (mut app App) get_item(mut ctx Context, id int) veb.Result {
	app.lock.@rlock()
	defer { app.lock.runlock() }
	for item in app.items {
		if item.id == id {
			return ctx.json(json.encode(item))
		}
	}
	ctx.res.set_status(.not_found)
	return ctx.json('{"error": "Item not found"}')
}

// 4. POST /api/items - Decodes JSON request body and adds a new item
@['/api/items'; post]
fn (mut app App) create_item(mut ctx Context) veb.Result {
	new_item := json.decode(Item, ctx.req.data) or {
		ctx.res.set_status(.bad_request)
		return ctx.json('{"error": "Invalid JSON format"}')
	}

	app.lock.@lock()
	defer { app.lock.unlock() }

	// Auto-increment ID based on length
	item_to_add := Item{
		id:   app.items.len + 1
		name: new_item.name
		done: new_item.done
	}

	app.items << item_to_add
	ctx.res.set_status(.created)
	return ctx.json(json.encode(item_to_add))
}

fn main() {
	// Initialize App with mock seed data
	mut app := &App{
		items: [
			Item{
				id:   1
				name: 'Learn V syntax'
				done: true
			},
			Item{
				id:   2
				name: 'Build a REST API in V'
				done: false
			},
		]
	}

	// Read port from environment variable or default to 8082 to avoid common conflicts on 8080
	port_env := os.getenv('PORT')
	port := if port_env != '' { port_env.int() } else { 8082 }

	println('Starting REST API server on http://localhost:${port}...')

	// Start veb web server
	veb.run[App, Context](mut app, port)
}
```

### Worker Pool Concurrency Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/03_worker_pool/worker_pool.v](boilerplate_templates/03_worker_pool/worker_pool.v)_

### Lesson: Worker Pool Concurrency Boilerplate

V offers lightweight concurrency out of the box. By combining `spawn` (thread creation) with typed channels (`chan`), you can build thread-safe worker pools that process computationally intensive or high-latency tasks in parallel without lock overhead.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Channel Communication**: Sending and receiving tasks and results over thread-safe queues.
- **Spawned Threads**: Running worker functions concurrently using the `spawn` keyword.
- **Synchronization with WaitGroups**: Using `sync.WaitGroup` to track and coordinate concurrent worker completion.
- **Monitor Thread Pattern**: Spawning a monitor thread to wait for workers to finish and close the results channel, avoiding channel deadlocks.
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Closing the tasks channel (`tasks_chan.close()`) to signal worker threads to cleanly exit.

```v
module main

import time
import sync

// Task represents the unit of work to be processed.
struct Task {
	id   int
	data string
}

// Result represents the outcome of processing a Task.
struct Result {
	task_id   int
	worker_id int
	output    string
	duration  time.Duration
}

// worker runs in a separate thread, consuming from tasks_chan and producing to results_chan.
fn worker(id int, tasks_chan chan Task, results_chan chan Result, mut wg sync.WaitGroup) {
	defer {
		wg.done()
	}
	for {
		// Receive a task from the channel.
		// If the channel is closed and empty, it returns `none`
		t := <-tasks_chan or { break }

		start_time := time.now()

		// Simulate intensive processing/I/O task
		time.sleep(50 * time.millisecond)

		elapsed := time.since(start_time)

		// Send the result to the output channel
		results_chan <- Result{
			task_id:   t.id
			worker_id: id
			output:    'Processed: ' + t.data.to_upper()
			duration:  elapsed
		}
	}
}

// wait_and_close waits for all workers to finish and then closes the results channel.
fn wait_and_close(mut wg sync.WaitGroup, results_chan chan Result) {
	wg.wait()
	results_chan.close()
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V Worker Pool Concurrency Boilerplate ===')

	// 1. Create channels for tasks and results with capacities
	tasks_chan := chan Task{cap: 10}
	results_chan := chan Result{cap: 10}

	num_workers := 3
	num_tasks := 5

	mut wg := sync.new_waitgroup()

	// 2. Spawn concurrent worker threads
	println('Spawning ${num_workers} workers...')
	for i in 0 .. num_workers {
		wg.add(1)
		spawn worker(i + 1, tasks_chan, results_chan, mut wg)
	}

	// Spawn the monitor thread to close results_chan when all workers are done
	spawn wait_and_close(mut wg, results_chan)

	// 3. Dispatch tasks to the queue
	println('Dispatching ${num_tasks} tasks to worker pool...')
	for i in 0 .. num_tasks {
		tasks_chan <- Task{
			id:   i + 1
			data: 'task-payload-${i + 1}'
		}
	}

	// 4. Close tasks channel to signal workers that no more work is coming
	tasks_chan.close()
	println('Tasks dispatched, queue closed. Collecting results...')

	// 5. Collect results from results channel by iterating until it is closed
	mut results := []Result{}
	for {
		res := <-results_chan or { break }
		results << res
		println('Received: Task #${res.task_id} from Worker #${res.worker_id} (took ${res.duration.milliseconds()}ms)')
	}

	// 6. Print summary
	println('\n=== Processing Summary ===')
	for res in results {
		println('- Task #${res.task_id} -> ${res.output} (Worker #${res.worker_id})')
	}
}
```

### OS and File Utilities Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/04_file_utilities/file_utilities.v](boilerplate_templates/04_file_utilities/file_utilities.v)_

### Lesson: OS and File Utilities Boilerplate

V's standard `os` module contains comprehensive and platform-agnostic tools for interacting with the file system and host operating system.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Path Manipulation**: Using `os.join_path` to build paths correctly across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- **File I/O**: Performing quick reads and writes using `os.read_file` and `os.write_file`.
- **Directory Operations**: Checking folder existence, recursively creating folders via `os.mkdir_all`, and listing files via `os.ls`.
- **Metadata Inspection**: Interrogating file properties like sizes and types (`os.is_file`/`os.is_dir`).
- **Resource Cleanup**: Ensuring system hygiene by safely removing files (`os.rm`) and folders (`os.rmdir`).

```v
module main

import os

fn main() {
	println('=== V OS & File Utilities Boilerplate ===')

	// 1. Join paths safely across different operating systems using os.join_path
	// V's home_dir() gives the user's home directory. Let's use it as a base path inside a temporary subfolder in workspace.
	cwd := os.getwd()
	temp_dir := os.join_path(cwd, 'temp_file_demo')
	println('Target directory: ${temp_dir}')

	// 2. Check if a directory exists, and create it recursively if not
	if !os.exists(temp_dir) {
		println('Directory does not exist. Creating...')
		os.mkdir_all(temp_dir) or {
			eprintln('Failed to create directory: ${err}')
			exit(1)
		}
	}

	target_file := os.join_path(temp_dir, 'sample.txt')
	println('Target file path: ${target_file}')

	// 3. Write data to a file (overwrites if it already exists)
	content_to_write := 'Hello V Developers!\nThis is a sample file created by the OS and File utilities boilerplate.'
	os.write_file(target_file, content_to_write) or {
		eprintln('Failed to write to file: ${err}')
		exit(1)
	}
	println('File written successfully.')

	// 4. Read data from a file back into memory
	read_content := os.read_file(target_file) or {
		eprintln('Failed to read file: ${err}')
		exit(1)
	}
	println('\n--- Read Content ---')
	println(read_content)
	println('--------------------\n')

	// 5. Query file metadata
	size := os.file_size(target_file)
	is_file := os.is_file(target_file)
	is_dir := os.is_dir(temp_dir)
	println('File properties:')
	println('- Size: ${size} bytes')
	println('- Is File: ${is_file}')
	println('- Is Directory: ${is_dir}')

	// 6. List all files and folders inside a directory
	println('\nListing contents of directory: ${temp_dir}')
	files := os.ls(temp_dir) or { []string{} }
	for file in files {
		full_path := os.join_path(temp_dir, file)
		file_type := if os.is_dir(full_path) { '[DIR]' } else { '[FILE]' }
		println('  ${file_type} ${file}')

### String Utilities Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/05_string_utilities/string_utilities.v](boilerplate_templates/05_string_utilities/string_utilities.v)_

### Lesson: String Utilities Boilerplate

This boilerplate demonstrates how to implement highly useful custom string operations that are not natively built into V's core string type. It highlights UTF-8 rune handling, string tokenization, filtering, and text manipulation.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **UTF-8 Safe String Reversal**: Reversing strings correctly by iterating over `runes` rather than raw bytes, ensuring multi-byte Unicode characters (like emojis) are not corrupted.
- **Title Casing**: Capitalizing the first letter of _each_ word in a sentence (V's native `.capitalize()` only capitalizes the first letter of the entire string).
- **Alphanumeric Palindrome Checking**: Checking if a string is a palindrome while ignoring non-alphanumeric symbols and character casing.
- **Rune-based Truncation**: Cutting off a string at a specific character limit and adding an ellipsis, avoiding splitting UTF-8 byte sequences.
- **Slugification**: Generating clean, URL-friendly slugs (e.g. low-cased, hyphen-separated, special characters stripped) from user-supplied titles.

```v
module main

// reverse_string reverses a string, properly handling multi-byte UTF-8 characters (runes).
fn reverse_string(s string) string {
	runes := s.runes()
	mut rev_runes := []rune{cap: runes.len}
	for i := runes.len - 1; i >= 0; i-- {
		rev_runes << runes[i]
	}
	return rev_runes.string()
}

// title_case capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
fn title_case(s string) string {
	words := s.split(' ')
	mut titled_words := []string{cap: words.len}
	for word in words {
		if word.len == 0 {
			titled_words << ''
			continue
		}
		titled_words << word.capitalize()
	}
	return titled_words.join(' ')
}

// is_palindrome checks if a string reads the same forwards and backwards,
// ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.
fn is_palindrome(s string) bool {
	// Filter to lowercase alphanumeric characters
	mut clean_chars := []rune{}
	for r in s.to_lower().runes() {
		if (r >= `a` && r <= `z`) || (r >= `0` && r <= `9`) {
			clean_chars << r
		}
	}

	for i in 0 .. clean_chars.len / 2 {
		if clean_chars[i] != clean_chars[clean_chars.len - 1 - i] {
			return false
		}
	}
	return true
}

// truncate cuts off a string at a specified limit (by rune count) and appends an ellipsis.
fn truncate(s string, limit int) string {
	runes := s.runes()
	if runes.len <= limit {
		return s
	}
	return runes[0..limit].string() + '...'
}

// slugify converts a string into a clean, URL-friendly slug.
fn slugify(s string) string {
	mut res := []rune{}
	mut last_was_dash := false

	for r in s.to_lower().runes() {
		if (r >= `a` && r <= `z`) || (r >= `0` && r <= `9`) {
			res << r
			last_was_dash = false
		} else if r == ` ` || r == `-` || r == `_` {
			if !last_was_dash && res.len > 0 {
				res << `-`
				last_was_dash = true
			}
		}
	}

	// Trim trailing dash if any
	mut slug := res.string()
	if slug.ends_with('-') {
		slug = slug[0..slug.len - 1]
	}
	return slug
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V Custom String Utilities Boilerplate ===')

	// 1. Reverse String (UTF-8 safe)
	phrase := 'Hello, 🚀 World!'
	println('Original:  "${phrase}"')

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/06_math_and_stats/math_and_stats.v](boilerplate_templates/06_math_and_stats/math_and_stats.v)_

### Lesson: Math and Statistics Boilerplate

This template showcases how to perform numerical operations and custom statistical computations on numeric arrays. It implements several custom algorithmic functions that are not built directly into V's basic numeric types or standard math package.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Iterating over elements to calculate min, max, sum, and average (mean) on float slices.
- **Array Sorting & Cloning**: Using `.clone()` to copy data and sorting arrays in-place using `.sort()`.
- **Median, Variance & Deviation**: Custom implementations to calculate distribution variance and standard deviation using V's `math.sqrt()`.
- **Factorial Calculation**: An iterative, overflow-aware custom factorial function using V's `!` result type to report overflow on inputs greater than 20.
- **Fibonacci Sequence Generator**: A custom dynamic programming function generating the first $N$ numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, using `!` to report overflow on inputs greater than 93.
- **Prime Number Checker**: A highly optimized primality test (`is_prime`) using trial division of form $6k \pm 1$.
- **GCD and LCM**: Custom implementations for finding the Greatest Common Divisor (Euclidean algorithm) and Least Common Multiple of two numbers.

### Array Utilities Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/07_array_utilities/array_utilities.v](boilerplate_templates/07_array_utilities/array_utilities.v)_

### Lesson: Array Utilities Boilerplate

V's standard array implementation is powerful but focused. This template showcases how to implement useful custom generic utilities for manipulating, comparing, and organizing arrays.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Generics in V**: Writing reusable algorithms using type parameters `[T]`.
- **Deduplication (`unique`)**: Removing duplicates from an array using containment checks (`!in`).
- **Chunking (`chunk`)**: Partitioning an array into smaller sub-slices of a fixed maximum length.
- **Set Operations (`intersection`, `difference`)**: Calculating overlapping elements and unique elements between two arrays.
- **Flattening (`flatten`)**: Condensing nested 2D slices (`[][]T`) into flat 1D slices (`[]T`).
- **In-place Shuffling (`shuffle`)**: Implementing the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm using V's standard `rand` package.
- **Weighted Selection (`weighted_choice`)**: Selecting elements from an array based on proportional bias (weights) to simulate probability distributions.

```v
module main

import rand

// unique returns a new array with duplicate elements removed.
fn unique[T](arr []T) []T {
	mut result := []T{cap: arr.len}

### Configuration Management Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/08_config_management/config_management.v](boilerplate_templates/08_config_management/config_management.v)_

### Lesson: Configuration Management Boilerplate

Most practical applications need configuration values that can come from a file, environment variables, or defaults. This template shows a clean pattern for loading a JSON config, falling back to safe defaults, and saving updated settings.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Default Configuration**: Establishing a safe baseline before reading external settings.
- **Environment Variable Overrides**: Adapting the app without changing source files.
- **JSON Persistence**: Reading and writing structured config files with `json.decode` and `json.encode`.
- **Practical Separation of Concerns**: Keeping parsing and application logic in dedicated functions.

```v
module main

import json
import os

struct AppConfig {
mut:
	host    string
	port    int
	debug   bool
	retries int
}

fn default_config() AppConfig {
	return AppConfig{
		host:    '127.0.0.1'
		port:    8080
		debug:   false
		retries: 3
	}
}

fn load_config(path string) AppConfig {
	mut cfg := default_config()

	// 1. If path is provided and exists, load config from the JSON file first
	if path != '' && os.exists(path) {
		raw := os.read_file(path) or {
			eprintln('Warning: could not read config file: ${err}')
			''
		}
		if raw != '' {
			cfg = json.decode(AppConfig, raw) or {
				eprintln('Warning: could not decode config file: ${err}')
				cfg
			}
		}
	} else if path != '' {
		println('Config file not found. Using defaults with environment overrides.')
	}

	// 2. Overlay / override with environment variables (crucial for production container envs)
	env_host := os.getenv('APP_HOST')
	if env_host != '' {
		cfg.host = env_host
	}
	env_port := os.getenv('APP_PORT')
	if env_port != '' {

	}
	env_debug := os.getenv('APP_DEBUG')
	if env_debug != '' {
		cfg.debug = env_debug == 'true'
	}
	env_retries := os.getenv('APP_RETRIES')
	if env_retries != '' {
		cfg.retries = env_retries.int()
	}

	return cfg
}

fn save_config(path string, cfg AppConfig) {
	data := json.encode(cfg)
	os.write_file(path, data) or { eprint('Failed to save config file: ${err}') }
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V Configuration Management Boilerplate ===')

	config_path := 'app_config.json'

	// Ensure we cleanup the generated file on exit
	defer {
		if os.exists(config_path) {
			os.rm(config_path) or {}
			println('Cleaned up temporary config file: ${config_path}')
		}
	}

	mut cfg := load_config(config_path)

	println('Loaded configuration:')
	println('- host: ${cfg.host}')
	println('- port: ${cfg.port}')
	println('- debug: ${cfg.debug}')
	println('- retries: ${cfg.retries}')

	cfg.debug = true
	save_config(config_path, cfg)

	println('Saved configuration to ${config_path}')
}

### JSON File Store Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/09_json_file_store/json_file_store.v](boilerplate_templates/09_json_file_store/json_file_store.v)_

### Lesson: JSON File Store Boilerplate

A simple JSON file store is often enough for small tools, prototypes, or local productivity apps. This template shows how to load persisted data from disk, add new records, update them, and save the state again.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Persistent Data**: Keeping application state across runs with a simple file-backed format.
- **Structured Records**: Storing typed data in a `TodoItem` model.
- **CRUD Style Helpers**: Adding, updating, and listing records without introducing a database dependency.
- **Safe Serialization**: Using `json.encode` and `json.decode` for portability.

```v
module main

import json
import os

struct TodoItem {
	id    int
	title string
mut:
	done bool
}

struct TodoStore {
mut:
	items []TodoItem
}

fn load_store(path string) TodoStore {
	if !os.exists(path) {
		return TodoStore{}
	}

	raw := os.read_file(path) or {

	data := json.encode(store)
	os.write_file(path, data) or { eprintln('Could not save store: ${err}') }
}

fn add_item(mut store TodoStore, title string) TodoItem {
	item := TodoItem{

		title: title
		done:  false
	}
	store.items << item
	return item
}

fn mark_done(mut store TodoStore, id int) bool {
	for i, item in store.items {
		if item.id == id {
			store.items[i].done = true
			return true
		}
	}
	return false
}

fn list_items(store TodoStore) {
	for item in store.items {
		status := if item.done { '[x]' } else { '[ ]' }
		println('${status} ${item.id}. ${item.title}')
	}
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V JSON File Store Boilerplate ===')

	store_path := 'todos.json'

	// Ensure we cleanup the generated file on exit
	defer {
		if os.exists(store_path) {
			os.rm(store_path) or {}
			println('Cleaned up temporary store file: ${store_path}')
		}
	}

	mut store := load_store(store_path)

	add_item(mut store, 'Write a V tutorial')
	add_item(mut store, 'Ship a new boilerplate example')

	println('Current todos:')
	list_items(store)

	if mark_done(mut store, 1) {
		println('Marked todo #1 as done.')
	} else {

### Retry and Backoff Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/10_retry_and_backoff/retry_and_backoff.v](boilerplate_templates/10_retry_and_backoff/retry_and_backoff.v)_

### Lesson: Retry and Backoff Boilerplate

Transient failures are common in distributed systems, network clients, and file operations. This template demonstrates a practical retry loop that delays between attempts and surfaces a final failure only after the allowed number of tries is exhausted.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Resilient Operations**: Using a generic function structure to wrap any callback in a robust retry cycle.
- **Exponential Backoff**: Multiplying delays by a backoff factor after each failed attempt to reduce load on resources.
- **Random Jitter**: Adding a small, random time variation (jitter) to sleep intervals to prevent synchronized retries (thundering herd problem).
- **Result & Error Propagation**: Leveraging V's `!` result type to return either the successful generic value `T` or propagate the final failure.

```v
module main

import os
import time
import rand

// RetryConfig configures the retry and backoff behavior.

### HTTP Client Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/11_http_client/http_client.v](boilerplate_templates/11_http_client/http_client.v)_

### Lesson: HTTP Client Boilerplate

Many real-world tools need to call web services. This template shows a simple yet practical pattern for performing HTTP GET and POST requests, decoding JSON responses, and handling failures with clear errors.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **HTTP Requests**: Using `net.http` for GET and POST requests.
- **JSON POST Headers**: Using `http.Request` directly to configure headers explicitly, including `Content-Type: application/json` for strict APIs.
- **JSON Payloads**: Encoding and decoding structured data with `json`.
- **Error Handling**: Returning and surfacing client errors cleanly.
- **Reusable Helpers**: Keeping request logic in dedicated functions for later reuse.

```v
module main

import net.http
import json

struct PostPayload {
	title   string @[json: 'title']
	body    string @[json: 'body']
	user_id int    @[json: 'userId']
}

struct PostResponse {
	id      int    @[json: 'id']
	title   string @[json: 'title']
	body    string @[json: 'body']
	user_id int    @[json: 'userId']
}

fn fetch_json(url string) !string {
	resp := http.get(url) or { return error('GET request failed: ${err}') }
	if resp.status_code >= 400 {
		return error('Request failed with status ${resp.status_code}')
	}
	return resp.body
}

fn post_json(url string, payload PostPayload) !PostResponse {
	body := json.encode(payload)

	// Set Content-Type explicitly for compliance with strict JSON APIs
	mut req := http.Request{
		method: .post
		url:    url
		data:   body
	}
	req.header.set(.content_type, 'application/json')

	resp := req.do() or { return error('POST request failed: ${err}') }
	if resp.status_code >= 400 {
		return error('Request failed with status ${resp.status_code}')
	}
	return json.decode(PostResponse, resp.body) or { return error('Invalid JSON response') }
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V HTTP Client Boilerplate ===')

	body := fetch_json('https://httpbin.org/get') or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}
	println('GET response body:')
	println(body)

	response := post_json('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', PostPayload{
		title:   'Ada'
		body:    'Developer'
		user_id: 1
	}) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}

	println('\nPOST response:')
	println('id:      ${response.id}')
	println('title:   ${response.title}')
	println('body:    ${response.body}')
	println('user_id: ${response.user_id}')
}
```

### CSV Processor Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/12_csv_processor/csv_processor.v](boilerplate_templates/12_csv_processor/csv_processor.v)_

### Lesson: CSV Processor Boilerplate

CSV files are still common for importing and exporting tabular data. This template shows how to read records from CSV, transform them into typed structs, and write them back out in a clean format.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **CSV Parsing**: Reading rows with `encoding.csv`.
- **Typed Data Models**: Mapping each row into a struct.
- **File I/O**: Reading and writing files with `os` helpers.
- **Practical Data Pipelines**: Transforming input files into processed output files.

```v
module main

import os
import encoding.csv

struct Person {
	name string
	age  int
	city string
}

fn read_people(path string) ![]Person {
	content := os.read_file(path) or { return error('Could not read ${path}: ${err}') }
	mut reader := csv.new_reader(content)

	mut people := []Person{}
	for {
		row := reader.read() or { break }
		if row.len == 0 {
			continue
		}
		if row[0] == 'name' {
			continue
		}
		people << Person{
			name: row[0]
			age:  row[1].int()
			city: row[2]
		}
	}
	return people
}

fn write_people(path string, people []Person) ! {
	mut output := []string{}
	output << 'name,age,city'
	for person in people {
		output << '${person.name},${person.age},${person.city}'
	}
	os.write_file(path, output.join('\n')) or { return error('Could not write ${path}: ${err}') }
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V CSV Processor Boilerplate ===')

	input_path := 'people.csv'
	output_path := 'people_out.csv'

	// Ensure temporary CSV files are cleaned up on exit
	defer {
		if os.exists(input_path) {
			os.rm(input_path) or {}
		}
		if os.exists(output_path) {
			os.rm(output_path) or {}
		}
		println('Cleaned up temporary CSV files.')
	}

	os.write_file(input_path, 'name,age,city\nAlice,30,New York\nBob,25,San Francisco') or {
		eprintln('Could not create sample CSV: ${err}')
		return
	}

	people := read_people(input_path) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}

	for person in people {
		println('Loaded: ${person.name} (${person.age}) from ${person.city}')
	}

	write_people(output_path, people) or {
		eprintln('${err}')
		return
	}
	println('Wrote processed CSV to ${output_path}')
}
```

### macOS Native GUI Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/13_simplegui/main.v](boilerplate_templates/13_simplegui/main.v)_

### Lesson: macOS Native GUI Boilerplate

V is not limited to command-line tools. This starter project shows how to build a native macOS desktop app with a small, beginner-friendly API over Cocoa. It is a practical bridge between simple scripting-style V code and real GUI development.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Native Window Creation**: Starting a real macOS window with `simplegui.new_simple_window(...)`.
- **Named Controls**: Creating labels, text inputs, buttons, checkboxes, sliders, and more with one-line helpers.
- **Event-Driven UI**: Connecting UI actions with callbacks such as `on_click` and `on_change`.
- **State Updates from V**: Reading and writing control values with helpers like `get_text`, `set_text`, `set_checked`, and `set_value_int`.
- **Crossing into Desktop Apps**: Showing how V can be used for interactive desktop experiences beyond console programs.

```v
module main

import simplegui

fn main() {
	mut gui := simplegui.new_simple_window('V Native GUI Demo', 760, 950)
	gui.set_title('V Native GUI Demo')
	gui.add_label('intro', 'Create controls with one small call')
	gui.add_input('name', 'Ada')
	gui.add_button('run', 'Run')
	gui.on_click('run', on_run_clicked)
	gui.run()
}

fn on_run_clicked(mut win &simplegui.SimpleWindow) {
	println('run clicked')
	name := win.get_text('name')
	win.alert('Hello', 'Hello, ${name}!')
}
```

The full project in this repository includes multiple demos and a reusable module implementation in [boilerplate_templates/13_simplegui/simplegui/simplegui.v](boilerplate_templates/13_simplegui/simplegui/simplegui.v), making it an excellent example for learners who want to move from console programs into desktop interfaces.

For the complete source, demo list, screenshots, and setup instructions, visit the original GitHub repository: https://github.com/codecaine-zz/vlang_simplegui/tree/master

To use the project end to end, open the folder at [boilerplate_templates/13_simplegui](boilerplate_templates/13_simplegui) and change into that directory first so it becomes the current working directory, then run the main demo with `v run main.v`. This matters because the example expects to be launched from its own folder. You can also explore the other demo files in the same directory to see the available UI patterns.

### Logging Boilerplate

_File location: [boilerplate_templates/14_logging/logging.v](boilerplate_templates/14_logging/logging.v)_

### Lesson: Logging Boilerplate

Structured logging is essential for debugging, monitoring, and understanding how an application behaves over time. This template shows a simple logger that writes messages with levels, timestamps, and optional file output.

Key concepts illustrated:

- **Log Levels**: Using `debug`, `info`, `warn`, and `error` categories.
- **Simple Logger Struct**: Encapsulating configuration and behavior in one reusable type.
- **File Output**: Appending log entries to a file for later inspection.
- **Filtering**: Only emitting messages at or above the configured severity level.

```v
module main

import os
import time

enum LogLevel {
	debug
	info
	warn
	error
}

struct Logger {
	log_file string
	level    LogLevel
}

fn (logger Logger) log(level LogLevel, message string) {
	if int(level) < int(logger.level) {
		return
	}

	timestamp := time.now().str()
	prefix := match level {
		.debug { '[DEBUG]' }
		.info { '[INFO]' }
		.warn { '[WARN]' }
		.error { '[ERROR]' }
	}

	line := '${timestamp} ${prefix} ${message}'
	println(line)
	if logger.log_file != '' {
		mut f := os.open_file(logger.log_file, 'a') or {
			eprintln('Failed to open log file: ${err}')
			return
		}
		f.write((line + '\n').bytes()) or { eprintln('Failed to append log: ${err}') }
		f.close()
	}
}

fn main() {
	println('=== V Logging Boilerplate ===')

	log_path := 'app.log'
	defer {
		if os.exists(log_path) {
			os.rm(log_path) or {}
			println('Cleaned up temporary log file: ${log_path}')
		}
	}

	logger := Logger{
		log_file: log_path
		level:    .info
	}

	logger.log(.debug, 'This debug message is filtered out')
	logger.log(.info, 'Application started')
	logger.log(.warn, 'Configuration value is missing')
	logger.log(.error, 'Something went wrong')
}
```

### Exercise 7: Modeling a Bank Account with Structs & Methods

This exercise covers Chapter 7: Structs (Custom Types).

> [!EXERCISE]
> Define a `BankAccount` struct with fields `owner` (string), `balance` (f64), and `is_active` (bool). Implement a value receiver method to display the account details, and mutable methods to `deposit(amount f64)` and `withdraw(amount f64)`. Ensure that a withdrawal cannot exceed the balance or occur on an inactive account.

> [!SOLUTION]
>
> ```v
> module main
>
> struct BankAccount {
> 	owner string
> mut:
> 	balance   f64
> 	is_active bool
> }
>
> fn (a BankAccount) display() {
> 	status := if a.is_active { 'Active' } else { 'Inactive' }
> 	println('Account Owner: ${a.owner} | Balance: $${a.balance:.2f} | Status: ${status}')
> }
>
> fn (mut a BankAccount) deposit(amount f64) {
> 	if !a.is_active {
> 		println('Cannot deposit: Account is inactive.')
> 		return
> 	}
> 	if amount > 0 {
> 		a.balance += amount
> 		println('Deposited $${amount:.2f}')
> 	}
> }
>
> fn (mut a BankAccount) withdraw(amount f64) {
> 	if !a.is_active {
> 		println('Cannot withdraw: Account is inactive.')
> 		return
> 	}
> 	if amount > a.balance {
> 		println('Cannot withdraw: Insufficient funds.')
> 		return
> 	}
> 	if amount > 0 {
> 		a.balance -= amount
> 		println('Withdrew $${amount:.2f}')
> 	}
> }
>
> fn main() {
> 	mut acc := BankAccount{
> 		owner:     'Jane Doe'
> 		balance:   150.00
> 		is_active: true
> 	}
>
> 	acc.display()
> 	acc.deposit(50.50)
> 	acc.withdraw(75.00)
> 	acc.display()
>
> 	acc.withdraw(200.00)
> }
> ```

> [!OUTPUT]
>
> ```
> Account Owner: Jane Doe | Balance: $150.00 | Status: Active
> Deposited $50.50
> Withdrew $75.00
> Account Owner: Jane Doe | Balance: $125.50 | Status: Active
> Cannot withdraw: Insufficient funds.
> ```

> Write a function `divide(a f64, b f64) !f64` that returns an error when dividing by zero. In `main`, call this function, handle potential errors cleanly using an `or` block, and print the results for both a valid division and an invalid division.

> [!SOLUTION]
>
> ```v
> module main
>
> fn divide(a f64, b f64) !f64 {
> 	if b == 0.0 {
> 		return error('division by zero error')
> 	}
> 	return a / b
> }
>
> fn main() {
> 	x := 10.0
> 	y := 2.5
> 	z := 0.0
>
> 	res1 := divide(x, y) or {
> 		println('Error: ${err}')
> 		return
> 	}
> 	println('${x} / ${y} = ${res1}')
>
> 	divide(x, z) or {
> 		println('Error occurred: ${err}')
> 		return
> 	}
> }
> ```

> [!OUTPUT]
>
> ```
> 10 / 2.5 = 4
> Error occurred: division by zero error
> ```

This exercise covers Chapter 10: Writing Tests in V.

> [!EXERCISE]
> Write a V library containing a public function `reverse_string(s string) string`. Write a corresponding test file `reverse_string_test.v` with unit tests verifying correctness for empty strings, single characters, palindromes, and multi-word sentences using assert statements.

> [!SOLUTION]
>
> ```v
> // reverse.v
> module main
>
> pub fn reverse_string(s string) string {
> 	mut runes := s.runes()
> 	mut i := 0
> 	mut j := runes.len - 1
> 	for i < j {
> 		temp := runes[i]
> 		runes[i] = runes[j]
> 		runes[j] = temp
> 		i++
> 		j--
> 	}
> 	return runes.string()
> }
>
> // reverse_string_test.v
> module main
>
> fn test_reverse_string() {
> 	assert reverse_string('') == ''
> 	assert reverse_string('a') == 'a'
> 	assert reverse_string('radar') == 'radar'
> 	assert reverse_string('hello world') == 'dlrow olleh'
> }
> ```

> [!OUTPUT]
>
> ```
> [PASS] test_reverse_string
> ```

### Exercise 11: Concurrent Task Aggregation with Channels

This exercise covers Chapter 11: Concurrency and Channels.

> [!EXERCISE]
> Write a program that spawns three concurrent v-routines. Each v-routine should compute a segment of a calculation (e.g. squaring a number) and send the result back through a shared channel. The main function should receive all three values from the channel, sum them up, and print the total.

> [!SOLUTION]
>
> ```v
> module main
>
> fn worker(id int, val int, ch chan int) {
> 	println('Worker ${id} starting to calculate square of ${val}')
> 	ch <- (val * val)
> }
>
> fn main() {
> 	ch := chan int{cap: 3}
>
> 	spawn worker(1, 4, ch)
> 	spawn worker(2, 6, ch)
> 	spawn worker(3, 8, ch)
>
> 	mut sum := 0
> 	for _ in 0 .. 3 {
> 		val := <-ch
> 		sum += val
> 	}
>
> 	println('Sum of concurrent square results: ${sum}')
> }
> ```

> [!OUTPUT]
>
> ```
> Worker 1 starting to calculate square of 4
> Worker 2 starting to calculate square of 6
> Worker 3 starting to calculate square of 8
> Sum of concurrent square results: 116
> ```

### Exercise 12: JSON Parsing and Validation

This exercise covers Chapter 12: Working with Databases and JSON.

> [!EXERCISE]
> Define a struct representing a `Task` with fields `id` (int), `title` (string), and `completed` (bool). Write a program that takes a JSON string containing an array of tasks, parses it into a V array of `Task` structs, and prints the titles of the tasks that are not yet completed.

> [!SOLUTION]
>
> ```v
> module main
>
> import json
>
> struct Task {
> 	id        int
> 	title     string
> 	completed bool
> }
>
> fn main() {
> 	raw_json := '[
> 		{"id": 1, "title": "Buy groceries", "completed": true},
> 		{"id": 2, "title": "Write V exercise guide", "completed": false},
> 		{"id": 3, "title": "Compile textbook HTML", "completed": false}
> 	]'
>
> 	tasks := json.decode([]Task, raw_json) or {
> 		println('Failed to parse JSON: ${err}')
> 		return
> 	}
>
> 	println('Pending Tasks:')
> 	for task in tasks {
> 		if !task.completed {
> 			println('- ${task.title}')
> 		}
> 	}
> }
> ```

> [!OUTPUT]
>
> ```
> Pending Tasks:
> - Write V exercise guide
> - Compile textbook HTML
> ```

### Exercise 13: HTTP Client & Query Parameter Parser

This exercise covers Chapter 13: Standard Library & Advanced Features.

> [!EXERCISE]
> Create a V program that imports the `net.http` and `net.urllib` modules. Build a small utility that sends a GET request to a public API URL or a dummy server, checks the response status code, and parses query parameters from a URL string, displaying each parameter's key and value.

> [!SOLUTION]
>
> ```v
> module main
>
> import net.http
> import net.urllib
>
> fn main() {
> 	resp := http.get('https://httpbin.org/get') or {
> 		println('Failed to send request: ${err}')
> 		return
> 	}
> 	println('HTTP GET Status Code: ${resp.status_code}')
>
> 	sample_url := 'https://example.com/search?q=vlang&limit=10&page=2'
> 	parsed_url := urllib.parse(sample_url) or {
> 		println('Failed to parse URL: ${err}')
> 		return
> 	}
>
> 	params := parsed_url.query()
> 	println('Parsed URL Query Parameters:')
> 	for key, values in params {
> 		println('  ${key}: ${values.join(', ')}')
> 	}
> }
> ```

> [!OUTPUT]
>
> ```
> HTTP GET Status Code: 200
> Parsed URL Query Parameters:
>   q: vlang
>   limit: 10
>   page: 2
> ```

### Exercise 14: Concurrent Worker Pool for String Transformation

This exercise covers Chapter 14: Useful Boilerplates and Application Templates.

> [!EXERCISE]
> Adapt the worker pool concurrent processing pattern to transform an array of lowercase strings to uppercase concurrently. Use a struct for `Job` and `Result` types, spawn multiple worker threads, feed the job channel, close it, and collect the results.

> [!SOLUTION]
>
> ```v
> module main
>
> struct Job {
> 	id   int
> 	data string
> }
>
> struct Result {
> 	job_id int
> 	output string
> }
>
> fn worker(id int, jobs chan Job, results chan Result) {
> 	for job in jobs {
> 		println('Worker ${id} processing job ${job.id}: "${job.data}"')
> 		results <- Result{
> 			job_id: job.id
> 			output: job.data.to_upper()
> 		}
> 	}
> }
>
> fn main() {
> 	num_jobs := 5
> 	num_workers := 3
>
> 	jobs := chan Job{cap: num_jobs}
> 	results := chan Result{cap: num_jobs}
>
> 	for i in 1 .. (num_workers + 1) {
> 		spawn worker(i, jobs, results)
> 	}
>
> 	words := ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']
> 	for i, word in words {
> 		jobs <- Job{
> 			id:   i + 1
> 			data: word
> 		}
> 	}
> 	jobs.close()
>
> 	for _ in 0 .. num_jobs {
> 		res := <-results
> 		println('Result collected: Job ${res.job_id} output = "${res.output}"')
> 	}
> }
> ```

> [!OUTPUT]
>
> ```
> Worker 1 processing job 1: "apple"
> Worker 2 processing job 2: "banana"
> Worker 3 processing job 3: "cherry"
> Worker 1 processing job 4: "date"
> Worker 2 processing job 5: "elderberry"
> Result collected: Job 1 output = "APPLE"
> Result collected: Job 2 output = "BANANA"
> Result collected: Job 3 output = "CHERRY"
> Result collected: Job 4 output = "DATE"
> Result collected: Job 5 output = "ELDERBERRY"
> ```
